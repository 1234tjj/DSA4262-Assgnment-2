No, I ended up reading that this sense of doom can be indicative of various health ailments; one of which I am prone to.. So on top of my "doom" to my gloom..I am now f'n worried about my heart.

__label__1 My mom then hit me with the newspaper and it shocked me that she would do this, she knows I don't like play hitting, smacking, striking, hitting or violence of any sort on my person. Do I send out this vibe asking for it from the universe? Then yesterday I decided to take my friend to go help another "friend" move to a new place. While we were driving the friend we are moving strikes me on my shoulder. And I address it immediately because this is the 4th time I have told him not to do these things, then my other friend who is driving nearly gets into an collision with another car i think because he was high on marijuana and the friend we are moving in the backseat is like "you have to understand I was just trying to get your attention" you know the thing 5 year olds do to get peoples attention by smacking them, this guy is in his 60's.

__label__1 until i met my new boyfriend, he is amazing, he is kind, he is sweet, he is a good student, he likes the same things as me, my family likes him, and so on... but i dont feel that passion that rush i felt with my ex, the truth is that when i started going out with my boyfriend i secretly saw my ex a few times to see if i really didnt feel nothing for him, but it was disgusting, i didnt even want him to touch me, i feel bad with myself i didnt want him, but still, i was there. then i kinda realized i felt nothing love related for him and it was ok, HE was HURT when he knew i was dating this boy and he even begged me to stay but of course not. but now the problem is that when im with my boyfriend i dont feel like i love him, like that thing you kinda have to feel with a new love, i just feel "ok" with him, and i catch myself thinking about my ex from time to time, remembering all the good things we had and it drives me crazy because i know that if i see him again i wont feel that way, that "love" that my mind makes me think stills there. and recently i found out that he has a girl and he is actually enjoying the experience and i got so mad and so hurt (i know i dont have any right to feel that way) i felt betrayed and I STILL feel that way, i gross myself out.

__label__1 October is Domestic Violence Awareness Month and I am a domestic violence survivor who is still struggling, even after over four years. Lately I have been feeling very angry. Angry that my abusive ex received no real consequences for his actions. This man abused me in all manners: physically, sexually, emotionally, verbally, financially, etc. I was granted a restraining order against him (and it was renewed a year later) but I was unable to press criminal charges against him because I didn’t have enough evidence to have a case.

__label__1 I think he doesn't want to put in the effort for the relationship to work (and we're both so difficult that we have to work on our relationships, doesn't matter with whom) but he can't be without me either. What should I do? I'm afraid this is gonna happen over and over again, because I'm always forgiving him at some point. Am I being strung along? TL;DR: Boyfriend [28,M] broke up with me [23,F] after on-off for 1.5 years, I thought we just got it together and am devastated...don't know what to do, want to keep fighting but should I?

__label__0 It was a big company so luckily I didn't have to see him all the time, but when I did, he again acted as though I didn't exist. I tried to talk to him and update him on the pregnancy, and ask him to be involved for our child's sake, and he literally stared right through me without saying a word. 3 months after our daughter was born, I texted him and told him he was missing out on the most amazing person in this world, and how it wasn't fair to her. To my surprise, he wrote back and wanted to see her. He apologized, said he had changed and within a couple of months, we were engaged.

To my surprise, he wrote back and wanted to see her. He apologized, said he had changed and within a couple of months, we were engaged.

On Monday I was thinking about humans and how the brain works and it tripped me out I got worried that because I was thinking about how the brain works that I would lose sleep and I did.

I got kind of scared like I did last time but this time I think that this is fake life which is absurd but I just think about it then get really scared then I think rationally then calm down.

__label__1 I actually give an assistant half my emergency fee to come help me sometimes. I feel unsafe driving to "house calls" in the middle of the night by myself.

Unhappy Husband: My husband is miserable both with his 60 minute commute and with our isolation out here in the country. We feel like we have no social life out here.

Only person I can really chat with is a pal I know at the bar. He has PTSD and shit from the military bad, hard up alcoholic nowadays after killing people.. We talk once every few weeks and we are open and it's cool. But normal people?

__label__1 Next week I’ll be flying for our family vacation. The flights won’t be very long (just MSY to LAS then LAX to MSY on the way home), but flying really triggers my anxiety. Mostly I just like having control over myself and my surroundings, so the idea of being in a metal tube 30,000 feet in the air is not ideal for me. I also have a lot of fears about terrorist attacks/mass shootings (movie theaters and other crowded public places are also a problem for me). I was wondering if anyone has any tips for flying anxiety/fear.

__label__1 Everything sets me off and I'm almost having a panic attack. I'm going to my dads soon and that also makes me anxious because I'm afraid that I'm not in the mental state to go there and I want to stay at my moms but he really isn't happy when I do that. Anyway when she complains or is feeling bad I comfort her and I've never raised my voice at her even when frustrated. When she thinks I disagree with her she raises her voice, I have to talk about what she wants to in general right now because she gets impatient easily. I feel like vomiting because she also has so many redeeming factors but I don't want to lose her as a friend.

When she thinks I disagree with her she raises her voice, I have to talk about what she wants to in general right now because she gets impatient easily. I feel like vomiting because she also has so many redeeming factors but I don't want to lose her as a friend.

__label__1 I’ve been taking 12.5 mgs zoloft for about 6 months (yeah, super small dose .. but it was taking the edge off, i think). I decided to stop taking it for a few days to see if it was really helping. Now, about 40 hours since my last dose, I’m suddenly kind of shaky and also flushed (my cheeks are burning for no reason. And THOSE side effects are about to freak me out - do you think it is from my missed dose? Is it possible to have such a fast reaction?

__label__1 No place in my city has shelter space for us, and I won't put my baby on the literal street. (I've been there before. Fine for new, but I don't want to have to go through that with a baby). What cities have good shelter programs for homeless mothers and children? I'd love to be able to make some calls and get on a greyhound between the 7th and 16th (when I'll likely be able to get the money to go).

__label__1 These past couple of months have been the worst. My anxiety has gotten so bad it’s effecting my sleep and relationship. I’ve become so paranoid about my health as well. I don’t feel like me anymore and I just feel scared all the time now over every little thing. I don’t have money to see a therapist either...

__label__1 I asked him three time what happened. And after the third time I cried and went home. Month later he still don't talk to me and he and my mother started fighting for the first time in the relationship. Me and my mother honestly don't know what to do, he just ignores me. I even told him that I don't date that guy(even though I date him) and he didn't even react to it.

__label__1 The sensation lasted hours. It seemed like a circulation problem, and I panicked and of course ended up in the ER again. This time a doctor came to see me immediately. He wanted to talk about my anxiety. He said he could run some more tests, but he didn't think it would help.

__label__1 It did hurt but didn’t leave any marks. When I lied down I kept coughing and today it feels kinda constricted like there’s a lump in my throat. I’ve googled and realised how serious it can be and now I’m terrified but scared to go doctor. What do I do I’m not calling police and I am not going to any hospital. I will go to doctor if they are sensitive about it

__label__0 We had plans to move in together, a fancy $1,800/month home that she would contribute $400 or so. We spoke of children, marriage, all sorts of stuff. It's not that I thought she owed me anything for me doing these things. It's just that I felt like I did so incredibly much and it kills me that I look back and know that over a 5 month period, we only had intimate contact less than 15 times, that we never made out, outside sex (and I initiated and was rejected many, many times). Every time I brought up my frustrations regarding my unmet romantic needs, she took it as gaslighting and used it as fuel to further drive the reason why she wasn't comfortable with intimate contact.

__label__0 I was going through a hard time after our breakup (started seeing a therapist and psychiatrist). In the span of the 2.5 years since our breakup I have had other boyfriends and hookups. Some of my hookups happened to be some of his old friends, the most recent happening 11 months ago. I never talked to these guys leading up to the hook ups or since, it was purely just spur of the moment drunk sex. Recently me and my ex have reconnected after 2.5 years of no contact.

__label__0 According to [a study from <url> and its subjects, major risk factors were family problems and a child’s lack of confidence. These factors aren’t necessarily easy to influence but well worth looking into. As is another avenue that we should focus on more: Support for survivors of sexual abuse. Availability and quality of mental health care comes to mind, but it’s not solely limited to the medical field. If we want abusers to be held accountable, we have to help victims because they might not come forward otherwise.

__label__1 If anything goes wrong, sexually, I want to cease to exist, and a lot of the time, I'm not able to do it out of sheer anxiety. I used to be a very soft person, and I hope I'm still kind, but now I'm quicker to anger, and I don't want to become an abuser. Basically... was I abused? Does that sound like something an abused person would say? I feel like I have the symptoms of PTSD.

__label__1 I really don’t know what to do about this, and I’m wondering if I’m even able to get over this fear. A traumatic experience compounded it in me as a kid, and I’ve been experiencing it for so long that it feels like second nature. It’s lkkely so ingrained with me that therapy won’t do much good. I need some help. If anyone can offer some, feel free.

__label__1 November has been one of the worst months in a long time. My mom was in a car accident and has no idea how she's getting to work. A few days later my grandmother died and I didn't even have enough money to attend the funeral. I drove home to be with my family, and to drive my mom 5 hours to the airport. I spent a ton on gas and now money is tight.

__label__0 This was a “nice thought”, and even though I had been told my mother to never leave a drink at the bar, it didn’t cross my mind that there might be something put in this drink or that I was being pushed to be more intoxicated. After I started sipping on that drink, I felt all the alcohol hit me and felt drunk. He said I’ve ordered an uber for us, which I thought I was being dropped back at home; I don’t actually remember the ride home in the Uber. We pulled up at his apartment complex, and he said come inside I know you’re hungry I have pizza. I thought eating pizza would be a good idea after the alcohol, so I followed him inside.

__label__0 This was a “nice thought”, and even though I had been told my mother to never leave a drink at the bar, it didn’t cross my mind that there might be something put in this drink or that I was being pushed to be more intoxicated. After I started sipping on that drink, I felt all the alcohol hit me and felt drunk.

__label__1 Sorry this going to be super long, I have a lot to say... Tl;dr... see title. It was constant up and down; one minute we were happy and he was being more affectionate than he has in years, the next he's screaming at me and calling me a whore. I get it, I broke him. I feel so disgusted and ashamed with myself but I truly want to spend my life with no one else.

She immediately got pregnant with me, and he married her, at which point the law washed their hands of the matter. I was born premature, 5 months and 3 weeks, which in 1981 was very dangerous. I spent 8 months in an incubator, and had heart surgery, but lived, and have not had health problems.

I thought I could hold it down, this has been an ongoing issue for about a year or so and it has never been this bad but lately it's getting to the point where I can't even talk to my own MOTHER without freaking out over this shit. She came back in town from a very long half year vacation recently and I had to go to dinner with her because that's what you're obligated to do and I had to sit there and try and make small talk with my brother the whole damn night looking anxious as fuck... I know they noticed.

__label__0 but I'm really, really afraid of public embarrassments and awkward situations. So I was in the train station and saw this homeless lady asking for food and money. I always help homeless people if I have change in my wallet. I walked up to her, took out my wallet and pulled out this £5 cash to give her. She was kinda old, so she wasn't in a perfect physical health.

Most adults get excited to tell you they did absolutely nothing during their break. And there was a time when I enjoyed taking a break too. But now it seems like every time I have a break or a day off from work, it makes the stress worse.

__label__0 I'm pretty healthy and have a silcock key for water but surviving the heat goes beyond just staying hydrated. Not enough food or the salt that comes with it led to bad cramps most mornings. Sleep was but a wishful dream. When the night time lows are still in the mid 90s, you just sortta sweat and doze. Flip your pillow when its soaking wet and repeat.

__label__0 I just got out of a four year, mostly on but sometimes off relationship. The last interaction we had, he was moving out. The night before, he had strangled me. We've had a toxic relationship, but mostly loving. He truly tried to love me as much as possible, but would get drunk and be verbally abusive.

__label__1 Hey everyone. I need a place to vent and place my feelings because I don't know what to do anymore. This evening while playing a boardgame with my BF and some friends, I found out my BF lied big time. Short: last year we decided that I would join him this year on his skiing trip with his friends (his idea). This wasn't possible in the end (or so he told me) because his friends didn't want to rent a cabin but go on a cheap student skiing trip.

__label__0 During the pregnancy and after the (traumatic) birth of our first child in 2013, symptoms started to intensify, including lots of depression, some manic behavior, and periodic angry outbursts. Somewhere in there we settled on a very (relatively speaking) effective combination of mental health meds that stabilized symptoms. We had our second child in 2015, after which an injury led to the discovery of a debilitating and incurable connective tissue disorder. The symptoms from this have been getting worse since then, and a good chunk of time from 2015 until now has been discovering what’s going on, coming to grips with a new reality, and managing those symptoms. Overall we’ve had a very healthy supportive relationship with strong shared values.

I just want to be okay and to have a good time on this trip, but I've been so out of it, and I'm at my wit's end. Right now I'm lying down and I feel blood rushing all through my head, and bulging of blood vessels around my nose. I'm extremely sleep deprived and woozy but I'm scared to go to sleep and am in pain. I'm so scared.

__label__1 I have PTSD from my sexual abuse, and this week has been really hard. Really, since Dr. Ford came out against kavanaugh and the fallout of it. Today, though, was really hard. I come home to see my father watching fox news and agreeing that Dr. Ford is a lying whore. His words.

__label__1 And I don't ask for the nightmares to drain me of all energy and make me feel worse throughout the day the harder I try to be normal. I was planning on seeking counselling without my parent's knowledge for this condition once I get to university and get settled, but now I'm wondering if I'm going to be told the same thing by a therapist there. I'm not looking for a diagnosis, just people who share my experience or know what I'm talking about. I'm sorry if this seems kind of ranty or rambling, my thoughts are a bit of a mess and I'm not sure what to think. Thank you for reading all this, anyhow.

__label__1 i knew gay was humiliation. i tried bringing up to my dad, and he said he wouldn't care if his son was a fudge packer, nor would he care bout that son anymore. i then had to speak to the bishop of my church and tell him about me possibly being gay. my dad was in the back of the room and another man i had never met wa sitting next to him. He asked me if i had ever had any gay encounters.

__label__0 I kept my head up and demanded the respect I deserve. I was very polite and expect the same. She wasn’t, so I put her in her place (she reprimanded me for leaving my gowns hung up in the dressing room). I came back to try on another gown and she goes you could at least bring them back. Mind you I have a one year old in my cart....

__label__1 In class, im always on edge, i cant focus on one thing for too long and i constantly scan my environment and I think they think im looking at them which im not. this also made it more awkward to talk to them. I been there for a month but im still very nervous around my peers and teachers. I know my teacher and the tutor there get nervous/uncomfortable around me, lately they haven't been talking to me much or coming up to me especially the tutor to ask if I need help  which they did before, my anxiety has gotten worse and I probably look more visibly uncomfortable than ever so that why they have barely asked if I needed help or said much to me ha! yet  seem more at ease with other people.

__label__0 I'm gonna try and get some sleep as it's the middle of the night here, and I hope I get through tomorrow with a single trigger, like I always wish for before I go to sleep. I hold that hope, and I know one day, it'll happen. Not now, but one day. Edit: Thank you all for your support and kind messages. It's really helped me get through today, and to keep moving forward, no matter how scary it seems, it's still moving forward.

__label__1 I know this may seem like a small thing, but to someone with these problems, it's a huge deal and to be at a store where you do not feel "safe" around your managers and you can't talk with them and grow as an employee, what's the point of continuing to work there? So I luckily got them to put me on 3rd shift. Minimal contact and I still get to work for the company. As I did mention, I have been struggling lately with some things: being slow with completing tasks on the work list is the biggest issue I believe. I'm not sure why I'm slow, in the past a supervisor has said "Yes you're slow, but you're thorough."

__label__1 I was consuming quite a lot of caffeine (up to 500mg per day) during the summer and I'm medicated with 18mg methylphenidate for ADHD. (I was rarely taking caffeine with methylphenidate together as there are a lot of side effects after doing that, one of them is anxiety and increased heart rate). I don't take methylphenidate now because of the high bp and my chest pains. I have an appointment to the cardiologyst but until then I'll have all my trial exams. I'm only 18 years old, is it really possible to have a chest angina at this age?

__label__1 But she says she can't stand hearing it because she's got enough on her plate as she actually suffers with depression herself. I do read other people's posts and think maybe I've actually had it easy. Maybe I'm just over exaggerating thing, but i feel like I need to get it off my chest. Anyway thanks for reading. ( sorry the post is so long ).

__label__1 I'm 24 and have massive amounts of stress going on with job hunting. I live with parents who are constantly on my back and getting angry with me for not having a job. They keep trying to help me by saying "oh this place is hiring and that place is hiring again." I have tried all places where I live and every time I don't get an interview let alone hired. Even if they have a sign up that they are hiring, they tell me "sorry we're not hiring right now."

__label__1 When I was a kid, I suffered a kind of unlikely injury that basically ruined me mentally, and it seems like I just CAN NOT get away from it, because it's such cheap gory shock value that everyone uses it when they need cheap gory shock value. And if I'm not mentally prepared to see it I have a panic attack or just start crying. A fucking jokey homebrew cursed item on r/DND did that to me today, and I hate that my trauma is so bad that I have to stay guarded even when I'm just reading a funny thread about my favorite hobby. I'm still thinking about that fucking item. I'm so tired.

__label__1 Any tips for making more friends? Tl;dr: I've had very few friends throughout my life. Recently I've tried reaching out to a lot of people but almost all of them will decline my offer to hang out at some point. I guess maybe this has to do with how I am socially awkward in the past but I've also been told that I am trying too hard. Any tips for making more friends?

__label__0 i remember her getting drunk and and ranting about a fuck buddy she was angry at. she came up with the brilliant idea of throwing a brick with a pie recipe tied to it through his window (i dont know). she told me to drive her to his house so she could do that and i said i didn't think it was a good idea. she told me if i didn't do it she would drunk drive there with my little brothers in the car. i haven't seen her in 6 and a half years.

__label__0 I think now she feels some of responsibility to help those in need and she gets a lot of gratification from these people who are very thankful to her. On occasion when we go out, we have been approached by these people and I can tell they are very grateful to her. We were at Starbucks while she's studying and the husband/wife she helped offered to buy her coffee, etc ... Lastly, her other dream is to get a house in this very rich neighborhood with houses that cost $2M at the very least. Anyways, enough with the bad, now the good things about her. She is a very loving person which is proven by the fact that everyone loves her at work.

__label__0 I looked regular for once and it’s been a while to feel that way. I wanted to show who I was today to the world, it was empowering seeing that face I used to be especially when I saw him just a month ago. I left right away to catch any train heading to North Hollywood and eventually arrived at the area of my work interview. I was early but I know I made a mistake without considering how hard it is to panhandle especially when you don’t look it for the part. I had a sign with me and I asked people to spare me a quarter at most but all I got were weird looks.

__label__1 Hello guys. This is my first post here. Ever since I can't fall asleep on a random night (few months ago) , I started getting anxiety at night and before heading to bed but everyday is different. Usually, when I get on bed n off the lights, my body started to heat up and i would sweat a little which makes me really uncomfortable. My heart would pound fast to which makes me anxious.

__label__1 I'm completely devastated. My cat was just hit and killed by a car. I don't think I'm allowed to bury him in the garden (we rent) and I don't know what to do. I've searched online and found loads of pet cremation services but they all cost a fortune. I don't have a penny to my name as I'm unemployed.

__label__1 Any help on how to stop ruminating? I work with some pretty toxic people and I can accept when people are ignorant and generally rude about my PTSD. I get it, some people are just really stupid and ignorant and won't understand how the assault affected me. But I spend WEEKS ruminating on all the things they've said, things they might say next... and the grounding techniques that my therapist suggests never stops it. How do you distract yourself from ruminating or arguing with people in your head?

__label__1 Through everything, I just froze and waited for it all to be over. Each time I petitioned her to stop, she would become very visible distressed. She spent a lot of time talking about suicide. During the school year, we exchanged letters every day at school that, in retrospect, sounded a lot like love letters from her part, but I chalked it up to a best friend love. I'd never been in a romantic relationship- I was 13 at that point, and didn't really know what that looked like anyway.

Thank you all if you consider helping! It means the world. I'll probably post again as the date gets closer. I aim to continue trying until I can get at least 100.

__label__0 After college for about 2 years, I focused on my career and wasn't totally putting myself out there. Now, for the last year, I've actively put myself in the dating pool. It never seemed appealing to hang around in clubs or bars to hopefully pick someone up, so I've mostly stuck to online dating. I was mostly pretty casually looking, and would go on there when the mood struck me or I was speaking to someone I saw potential with. Over the course of the last about 2.5 months, I've been on 3 dates.

__label__1 I got 6 stitches. My parents love my bf and in fact, my mom and him are so close that they go on walks and go to the movies together. I felt uncomfortable and unwanted by his family. To be fair, I was also a little closed off with them but mainly because I felt so unwanted. I have put on some weight, which I am sure his dad noticed because he absolutely hates fat people.

__label__1 I've never spoken to anyone about my anxiety but I'm pretty sure I have generalized anxiety disorder. When I was young I used to be very bright and would take charge of projects and doing assignments. As time went on I became lazier but still fairly on top of things. When I went into college I suffered and things never clicked. Doing even the most simple of tasks or assignments were just so difficult for me.

__label__1 This sends me into an extreme anxiety spiral, because I'd been seeing his mother almost every weekend for nearly five years, and she does this at the drop of a hat. I understand she was just trying to protect her son, but the level of nastiness was just insane. I had to get our old counsellor - mine and N's - involved to speak to her. She said the mother is taking things seriously. I don't believe it.

__label__1 I have four kids full time, almost a year ago their dad was removed because of substantial abuse. It's been incredibly hard making ends meet by myself and although I get rent paid, all other bills are stuck on the back burner. Our electric bill is over $400 and they're demanding $225 as a minimum payment. It's scheduled for disconnect today and I can't put it off any longer. I know it's a long shot but seriously needing a miracle at the moment.

__label__0 I was never really close to him, our conversations never went past the 'nice weather we're having' area. But I coincidentally ran into him at a bar recently and I initially tried to keep my distance from him because I know he's friends with Zach, but then he told me that not only does he and Zach are no longer in contact with each other, they actually really dislike each other now. I'm guessing something went down after Zach and I broke up. After that, I was more comfortable around him. So, as the night went along and we got drunker, we ended up hooking up.

__label__1 I get anxious because I am worried about bad things that I think may happen in my life. Im worried about losing my job, my girlfriend might leave me for someone more funny, with a better job, that is more self confident etc. You think these things because you perceive yourself to have no value. I get so preoccupied with these worries and it constantly undermines my self esteem that it applies to other areas in your life, even everyday interactions, going to the store, these can be extremely stressful events. You're so unconfident in yourself that you have a million thoughts a second and constantly second guess yourself.

__label__1 I get anxious because I am worried about bad things that I think may happen in my life.

__label__0 Hi I just wondered if any of you could offer some advice on this situation. I bought a house year ago, but I am yet to move in. I am in my early thirties but suffer from long-term depression, although I appear entirely normal in my appearance and in my communications with people, albeit a little quiet. I am currently still at home with my parents.

__label__1 (Hurt the ego, but whatever, I guess you're not always gonna be the hottest guy she's ever been with.) Then I found another thing that pretty much destroyed me - an e-mail to her high school boyfriend begging him to come visit her and have sex with her, because of how fantastic it was when they used to have sex. This was probably half a year after we had split up, and the implied comparison with me was pretty clear. Making matters worse is that this guy basically checks all the boxes on shit that makes me insecure - tall, douchey rich guy (in contrast to me - 5'8", not at all douchey guy with a good but not incredibly glamorous career). Anyway, these pieces of information - that she pretty much opened up to me sexually only when she felt threatened by another woman, and that she has clearly been with other guys who she's had much more sexual interest in than me - pretty much led me to the alternate hypothesis that it wasn't the vaginal pain and the birth control so much as her lack of attraction to me in comparison to past boyfriends.

__label__1 There's a TL;DR at the bottom for those who wanna get to the point this gets kinda lengthy. Hi, I'm 19 and this is my first time posting here and I'm hoping at least one person can relate. Before a few months ago I never had to deal with anxiety really, but out of nowhere it hit me like a truck. I guess what's been causing it is relationship issues, but mostly health anxiety. My first major mistake was googling symptoms I started having, not realizing that it was normal for anxiety to cause physical symptoms.

__label__0 The simplest breathing technique can help you calm your mind. It's called diaphragmatic breathing. Simply, place your hands on your belly, then ribs, then upper chest and practice breathing into your hands. At the end, you place one hand on your belly and the other on your heart and breath into your belly up to your heart and back out again. By placing my hands on your body, you can choose a certain number of breaths to count and focus on the physical sensation of your hands rising and falling.

Pretty physical job, push/pulling things that are up to 150lb quite often during my day. - Came into this job while recovering from a bulging disc in my lower back (L5/S1) - A medical certificate was provided to my employer advising that I have a back injury going into this job.

__label__1 I've tried getting new glasses, but that didn't help. Blood work came back fine. I have tried medication but only helped with anxiety not focusing issue. Some days I just straight out can't focus. Luckily, when I'm on auto-pilot and distracted, I can get a lot done.

__label__0 Even when (now talking about other times) I tried to be playful and like scare prank him, he would beat me up for it. And I still looked up to him for some reason. I believe no child should ever experience these kinds of things. They always drag themselves into your future life. In my case, I have sworn to myself to never become like my father, but I still have these... well, issues.

__label__1 Sorry for such a jumbled mess of a post. Edit: I realize I never expanded on the dissociation or depression. Because of my dissociation, while he was being abusive he would often say things like, "You're just remembering wrong. (gaslighting/rewriting history)" "You have bad memory. That never happened."

__label__0 Trauma survivors often don’t need more awareness. They need to feel safe and secure in spite of what their awareness is telling them. At the first sign of anxiety or depression, traumatized people will spiral into toxic shame. Depending on the wounding messages they received from their abusers, they will not only feel the effects of anxiety and depression, but also a deep shame for being “defective” or “not good enough.” Many survivors were emotionally and/or physically abandoned, and have a deep rooted knowledge of the fact that they were insufficiently loved. They live with a constant reminder that their brains and bodies were deprived of a basic human right.

__label__0 These weren't the only punishments, though. Sometimes he'd make us choose a favorite toy or plushie to be thrown out if we'd made him mad, and one time when he caught me rescuing my plushie, he slapped me across the face, then made me watch him cut her into little pieces, standing there at 1 in the morning berating me about how I was a stupid, ignorant little bitch that needed right and wrong beaten into her, because I was too stupid to to know how to do as I was told. Sometimes, though, he'd not just snap and get angry... He'd utterly lose control of himself. Screaming so furiously I couldn't really understand him, grabbing me by the arms/shoulders and shaking me hard enough to give me whiplash, and continue screaming over me once I collapsed in a cowering heap when he let go.

__label__0 Ok so firstly I should say she hasn't been formally diagnosed but it's at this point a logical conclusion that she's suffering some kind of ptsd from a rape that she endured a couple years back. It was before I knew her and when we met she seemed to be pretty stable. Although I know now that's not the case. I do not blame her at all for this behaviour but I really need help understanding her before I get hurt worse than I already have. Going forward keep in mind 2 things:

__label__1 My therapist says this is a normal behavior to display. Having been ripped from my children and left on the streets is very hard and i honeslty want to give up. But the anxiety swirls to the point i keep trying to find where i went wrong. It replays and plays in my head over and over like a horror movie. The feeling of wanting to die because at that point i had nothing left.

__label__0 I've been with Mike for 4 years now. We have an amazing relationship and I never felt bothered by anything in it, not even silly arguments that are more than common between a couple. Mike has a best friend named Theo. Theo is a cute guy who never seems to settle down, but not in a womanizer way, more like, he hasn't found the one. Well, hadn't found the one.

__label__1 He keeps going back to her. He even cleans up the messes she makes when she smashes his stuff. He has dropped all of his dreams because she doesn't approve of them. Sorry for the long post but it sucks hearing that he is in this situation and we just want our friend back so he can recover from this. He used to be the funniest and happiest guy around and now he is just broken.

__label__1 My Father has been struggling with alcoholism for nearly his entire life, he hasn’t been in contact with myself, my mom, or my sister in years. I guess it all of sudden caught up with him, he past away from a heart attack recently. It still doesn’t feel real, but my girlfriends family has been nothing but supportive throughout the whole thing and helped me grieve through his death. Needless to say, I do not want to attend a funeral or memorial, because I’d like to remember the good times I had with him and not being up bad memories. I had a rough child hood, he cheated on my mother, he wasn’t a great guy.

__label__1 I know there are a lot of bad stories on here about therapy. But I was wondering about good experiences. My own experience was six weeks ago. I slipped and went on s bender, I fell into a depressive, suicidal crisis. I phoned every crisis line that exists, for ten hours, well getting drunker and drunker.

__label__0 I will stay with the sub to offer any advice I can but thought a success story was worthy to share. They say never destroy a person's hope. It may be all they have left. Much love to you all for the good tips and advice during my struggle. Thanks!

__label__0 I cant do a push up. My arms are almost useless. I need to get surgery, but my parents aren't exactly in the picture and can't support me while I take time off of work to get the surgery. Would I be able to qualify for disability to be able to support myself so that I can get surgery? if not, what kind of options do I have?

__label__1 Like the title says, I’m rapidly losing motivation. I recently switched collages to be closer to home, so I could be closer to family. And my depressive spirals are coming more often, mainly because of the lack of work I do. I always end up doing things at the last damn minute. My freshman year I tried my best, almost.

__label__1 I barely slept in the hospital because I stayed up at night and listened for codes with his room number. I was terrified, constantly living in fear from the moment I awoke until about his 7th day in the hospital when he seemed clearer, and sat up with assistance for the first time. Fast forward to now. We are lucky to be alive, and we are injured. We’ve been robbed of a normal engagement, of the experience of moving in together, and that’s a grieving process...but my mind...is not what it was.

__label__0 These things seem dumb and I swear to God I didn't think they'd work, but a therapist I had told me about them and they actually do work. To stop a feeling of rage: Stand straight with your feet apart. Raise your arms as high as you can above your head, and put your hands together (like people do when they're praying). Stretch as high as you can. Jump and land on the floor, bringing your hands down between your legs, and hold that position for a few seconds.

__label__0 We added a bunch of [security <url> for specific scenarios. If you're more comfortable keeping things on reddit, we put a lot of the same information on r/operationsafeescape. Either way, if you feel your computer's being monitored, check out our [secure <url> guide. Also, we're hosting our first <url> in October.

__label__0 After meeting last year, Amanda and Isaac became incredibly close and agreed to live together for their Senior year. This past November, Amanda got drunk at a party and ended up making out with a random guy (on Jeff's birthday). Because of this, Amanda told Jeff that she wanted to take a break. Lots of drama. Everyone was shocked because from the outside, Amanda and Jeff seemed to have a really strong relationship (dating for 4+ years).

__label__1 Now I know everyone is going to maybe think it's from the suboxone but it or at least used to be one of the things that helped my anxiety. If I admitted myself I am afraid they'd admit me and make me go cold turkey. I am unemployed and looking for employment. I live with my grandparents. I'm a 28 year old male.

__label__1 Strangely enough, I had buried all this. But when my parents also failed to realise that my sister was on meth and neglecting her children, who are very dear to me, it sort of doubled the trauma and now I have full blown trauma. I feel like my parents just aren't trustworthy. How can they live in such an oblivious bubble? I wouldn't put any faith in them to protect me now and feel that I'm in this world on my own.

__label__0 Again, most of the time I can just say 'ah, screw 'em they're not a doctor' but you know how it goes when you're having an episode. Phew, ok! Sorry for such a long post, I just usually like long reads on Reddit so I figure it's ok. Feel free to share your experiences with feeling "fake!" It's good to not feel alone. TL;DR I sometimes feel like I'm faking having PTSD despite never expecting I had it and then getting an official diagnosis from a doctor.

__label__0 I cant take video of him due to the lights aimed in the wrong direction and the thick trees and bushes, theres a security cam but i DOUBT its aimed at that back area of the parking lot. Its amazing how many trips down a major road he can make without a cop asking why hes wheeling a friggin COUCH down the road at 4am. And i dont want to start hitting him with the blunt side of my axe, due to my situation im not real strong, and since i grew up in this area, i wasn't "street trained" like what people might call a "thug". So, any suggestions on how i can get rid of this guy but also not have to the area myself at least for a little while, till i can get my bike fixed, i use this library for my work on my laptop, so i kinda want to remain close. Thanks,

__label__0 To put it straight. I get anxiety when something changes on my body, be it hearing or any senses. I was in a car with my father and he has this 2K dollar professional stereo system in his car. He sat on the remote and all the sound went up to it's highest point. I was able to cover my ears, but with my forearms.

__label__0 The $4 cable I usually get fr Dollarama is out of stock, the cheapest I can find is $7 at a different dollar store, but nothing less than $30 at London Drugs and The Source. Here's where it gets complicated: my bank account is in a weird limbo right now and I don't know how much to ask for. My current balance is about $3, but my monthly service charges haven't been applied yet. So I know I'm going to be overdrawn, but the service charge varies depending on how many transactions I did, so I don't know how much I'll be overdrawn. Looking over the last 6 months the charge has ranged from $6 to $24.

Looking over the last 6 months the charge has ranged from $6 to $24.

__label__1 I don't even know that I feel lonely. I was fine with all this until my boyfriend asked out of concern because he thought maybe I was depressed or something and pushing everyone away. Then it was like he knocked down a wall inside me that I didn't know was there and revealed a whole room full of cobwebs. I feel ashamed and defective and hopeless now. But I don't know what to do.

I told her I thought it was a bad idea, that she should finish what she had left (she's an excellent student, super smart and committed) and then go to study the other career. But if she decided to leave I would support her 100%. She decided to quit. The other career was in another town, my home town (<2hs away) she rented an apartment with 2 girls and moved away.

__label__1 I am so confused! Why is he playing these games? I have made it clear I want him back and to me it’s like he has feelings but is unwilling to say anything? TL;DR I’ve been dating a guy for a few months, we split up over a silly petty argument, since we’ve split up he’s been maintaining that he wanted us to break up but he’s checking in on me and asking what I’m doing. Is he just being controlling or does he have feelings still?

__label__0 I feel like I'm starting to get the control back over my life slowly. I'm resignating to my situation and I'm ready to make things better for myself. I have stable relationship with my very supportive wife, my ambitions are growing back slowly... I finnaly have hope and I could hardly ask for more. I asked my doc to lower my Effexor because I feel like the the side-effects outweigh the good it does: It doesn't really help much for my anxiety, I feel depersonalization ever since I'm on medications and finally it gives me uncontrollable cravings.

It was only people I remember from years ago in MS and HS, or people I have met several times. The night was full of a series of moments that I will be kicking myself in the head for later-- starting with the fact that I introduced myself to someone with "I haven't seen you in a while!" and they said "Oh really?

I would be able to take PayPal, Cash App (I no longer have the card but can transfer to bank), a Kroger/Fry's egiftcard or an old T-Mobile phone / unlocked one if someone is local (around <location> ) and wants to meet up even after hearing about my socks. I do have a police report number if anyone needed to verify.

I would be able to take PayPal, Cash App (I no longer have the card but can transfer to bank), a Kroger/Fry's egiftcard or an old T-Mobile phone / unlocked one if someone is local (around <location> ) and wants to meet up even after hearing about my socks. I do have a police report number if anyone needed to verify.
__label__0 I have replaced my bank card and everything else is canceled, but still haven't went to get a replacement license (another expense I don't really want to think of right now), so I am unable to get one of those free government phones.

__label__1 I am ignoring him, that's not what this post is about. Basically, after all this time my ex has recently, decided he "knows" I cheated on him our entire relationship [I didn't], "knows" I'm this chick online who post XXX pictures of herself [I'm not] and has "reminded" me of incidences of our relationship that has literally never happened. Like, for one example *"...that time I called you from jail, and you cried b/c you were at a guys house and you knew what you did was wrong so you told me you needed help..."* yet he won't show me any evidence (it doesn't exist)... He's literally fabricating things out of thin air and claiming they happened. He isn't denying that he was an abuser, but he's saying like "You were bad too!

__label__0 I was dealing with depression for months feeling like I'd failed life at 18 and quit my job to finish off my college education and thats where we met. We were in the same class and used to stare at each other all day long so i followed her on instagram and noticed she was going to a club in my town that night so convinced my friend to come out as i really needed to bump into this girl and give it a shot. so we did. When i walked in, she was there it, was crazy we locked eyes and without saying much she walked up and just started kissing me. we were guy and girl from that moment we did so much stuff together like holidays then she even moved into my parents place.

__label__1 I'm just scared to death. I have anxiety problems which are probably contributing to it. But he keeps telling me he'd never judge me for anything and my sister said if he's OK with a missing tooth, he should be OK with a gap. I'm worried he'll see me and change his mind about me and I don't know what to do. Should I tell him about it first or just see what happens?

__label__1 This has made me really question where I am and if I should be staying put. Sort of if where I was was right I wouldn't be feeling like this is now. I'm not thinking I should leave for the sake of being single to see someone else but maybe if I'm not as happy as I thought I should be leaving for me to have some time and space to do things on my own. Any suggestions reddit? **tl;dr my crush on my driving instructor is making me think about leaving my boyfriend**

__label__1 I have had the worst anxiety of my life recently. As a college student I am now falling behind in classes, forgetting about sorority events and not interacting with my friends. I am slowly losing my mind. My room is a mess and the only thing keeping me out of a mental hospital right now is literally my students where I student teach. I am exhausted of fighting to get out of bed everyday, shaking when I sit in class and just not talking to anyone.

__label__1 If I hadn’t have grabbed my toddlers head and pressed it against mine and ducked it would have hit us both. I was yelled at so much I could see the veins bulging in his neck as he swore at me and called me names. I held my hands over the children’s ears so they couldn’t hear. But at least he didn’t hit me. I was told repeatedly that I would be stabbed in the throat so he didn’t need to hear my voice.

__label__0 My ex and I of 3 years broke up and he kicked me out and caused me to get fired by telling our problems at work(we worked together) so they chose to keep him and fire me. Now I am 2 weeks out of work but I do think I will have a new job next week! Thank the lord. I have 8 bucks to my name and I just really need some advice on what I should do to survive until I have more money. I can't believe I am even in this position in life.

__label__1 I feel like I'm going to go insane. I can't stop crying or wanting to pull my hair out or screaming. I can't stop shaking. I'm on medications for anxiety and they help some but not much and not often... Ultimately, I know I'm not me anymore.

__label__0 When I asked her how it happened, she said her brother had accidentally elbowed her in the face when they were 'rough-housing'. There was something about the way she said it that seemed a bit off to me - like she had been practising her excuse (or maybe that was in my head). Whatever the case it struck me as maybe a little weird that a couple of 20-something siblings would be play-fighting with each other like 10 year olds. This morning, after an absence of several days, she arrived at the office with a broken wrist. Her arm is in a cast and she has metal rods holding the broken bones in place.

Whatever the case it struck me as maybe a little weird that a couple of 20-something siblings would be play-fighting with each other like 10 year olds. This morning, after an absence of several days, she arrived at the office with a broken wrist. Her arm is in a cast and she has metal rods holding the broken bones in place.

__label__1 Hi everyone I have GAD that gets much stronger/prevalent when I don't have enough sleep. Coincidentally, it also makes me unable to sleep sometimes, so kinda like a vicious circle. Normally, I don't really have that many problems with it but I just started a new fulltime job with a lot of responsibility and that triggered my insomnia and subsequently all the underlying fears. My doctor prescribed Xanax as a when-needed last resort but since I was really scared of withdrawal/addiction after reading up on the drug (it's not called Xanax here but alprazolam) I only started taking 0.5mg at night after really breaking down.

__label__1 I am so sleepy and want to sleep so bad but the second I lay down it gets worse. My chest and stomach actually tighten up with anxiety and *all* I can do is think about Pippa. Now, what I did was irresponsible and I *should* feel bad about it. But this level of anxiety about something that happened 6-7 years ago that I can't do anything about now is insane. I tried talking to my family about it, but they even disagree on the basic premise that Pippa was even neglected.

__label__1 My current boyfriend wasn't right, just a figure of the coma induced illusion. The only voice that seemed remotely really was my best friend, she's one of the few regular poodle I still have contact from that time. After a hour of my boyfriend, my best friend and my other partner working with me, I slowly started coming to some balanced sembelrnce of reality. Now I'm scared to go back to sleep. My ex, who abused me for 11 years, might be waiting tight there for me again.

__label__0 Really hoping someone might have some insight for me! A couple years ago I (31,F) befriended one of colleagues (28,M). We were working for a small company that was also hemorrhaging cash, and eventually it was just him, me and some older coworkers in this open space office. Anyway, we really got along! We would have lunches, text in the evenings and weekends, and often go to the pub after work.

__label__0 I know what it means to dive into oneself. I asked him and he confirmed its a deeper variant. I got excited. There’s no switching out of consciousness, you can reject what he says, your totally in control (or so he’s telling me :)). So the first part was getting me deep, through counting, dropping my hand and other techniques I went deep.

__label__0 Hi all! I don’t exactly know where to start, but here goes. I have been on my own since 17, as I do not talk to my biological parents or my aunt that took care of me until 17. I went to college this last year in NC, but had to move back and stay with a friend due to low finances. While in college, I suffered from a concussion and mold poisoning from my dorm room.

__label__0 As for internet, I pay $60/mo on my phone for unlimited talk, text, and data without any throttling at all (thanks StraightTalk)! If I want internet on my laptop, I download the PdaNet+ app, download the .exe app on my phone then transfer to my laptop, install the app, then switch the tethering on so my laptop can connect and have access. That way, I can apply for more jobs on sites that my phone can't open up. So far, I'm doing okay. Just thought I would like to share how's my day been doing.

__label__0 I felt the tension and the seriousness. Usually during lockdown drills things aren't too serious because we're high schoolers. We mess around because we know nothing is wrong. But this drill was different. We knew we were all okay, that everyone was safe, but the atmosphere was completely different.

__label__1 I wonder what I would be like if I had gotten help earlier on. **Here's where I could use some input: I don't consider myself mentally ill. I hate the word. If someone asked me if I was, I'd deny it but I know I have PTSD and I guess that does make me ill by definition. Will I be considered mentally ill forever?

__label__0 Even moreso with a little push from behind. I've also been interviewing and applying for more secondary jobs to supplement my current employment and that seems to be going increasingly well. Thank you so much again everyone who sent food items to me, I'll be sure to pay it forward someday! EDIT 8/10: I received -even more- stuff just a few days ago, some pasta and sauce and then oatmeal too! Thank you so much, mystery redditor!

__label__1 He has been my best friend since the first day we met, he treats me great, he is always loving, not at all selfish, etc. We rarely fight and have only had maybe 2 other big arguments which we worked out. I am just so hurt over what he said to me. Do I just let it go and move forward with his apology? Like I said, it’s  not like either of us ever drink and the only reason we made it a point to drink so much was because I spent so much on the alcohol package for vacation.

__label__1 I would like to leave there, but I'm terrified of a shelter. I'm also a semi observant Jewish woman. Most shelters won't help me keep kosher and keep Shabbat, both of which are important to me. The Rachel Coalition is for domestic violence only, so I can't go there. The NCJW shelter in the area doesn't accept the voucher welfare would offer me.

__label__0 	It was the summer, I had just started a new job as a bartender.  I met a girl that was equally odd, had a lot of similar interests, was looking for the same thing I was.  We quickly became enamored with each other. It didn't take long for us to move in together.  I started finding projects around the house to fix up, she would surprise me with home cooked meals or a note gushing over our relationship.

__label__0 I’ve always been the type of person who’s been gravitated towards romance. The thought of loving someone and being loved in return was nice but I’m a closed off person who’s too afraid to let someone in. I recently got into a relationship with someone who is really incredible. He’s very patient and understanding about my anxiety and depression. It took a while and a few arguments for me to open up a little bit.

__label__1 It’s only happened 3/4 times recently but I’ve been putting off having sex and I’m constantly worried that my girlfriend doesn’t think I’m into her or that I’m losing interest, and so on. I’ve only just mentioned to her that I might be struggling with some form of anxiety. It’s a vicious circle at the moment. It’s almost as if I can’t relax and if I have nothing to worry about I create something to worry about. What do you guys think?

__label__1 One of the couples has a four-year-old daughter. We live in a two bedroom apartment. I constantly have to do shit for these people. One of the wives scolds me  constantly and tells me I need to show more respect for my parents. They leave needles out everywhere and when I inevitably step on one I'll probably end up with an STD.

__label__1 I hate the thought that even after my mom's death she still has power over me. Anyways, I've come here for advice on meds, specifically if this sounds like a good place to start. I used to just focus on the anxiety and insomnia acutely but never really tried to treat the source. I'm starting Effexor XR, Prazosin for the horrendous nightmares and continuing on clonazepam for panic attacks. Thanks guys!

__label__1 My father has: Keys to a fancy car, like 5 fancy bikes, an iPad, member of a fitness center, goes to the sauna regularily, other women... Needless to say, they should just break up immediately, right? Well, it should be that simple, but my mother resists for some reason. We had this situation countless times, where she was like, I cannot cope with this anymore, let's find another place to live in, until you find something for yourself, and when things are about to happen, she goes nah, I don't know... Which is so frustrating to hear after a while. Even more so, when he says things like HE decides when or if they split up.

__label__0 Hi, I was recently put on Prozac (10mg to start) for anxiety after a really bad panic attack. I am nervous but also hopeful that this will help me. For the first week I cried at least once a day and usually there was no reason, my anxiety is also heightened but I knew these symptoms would occur so I've been dealing with it fine. But for the past like day and a half I feel like my joints are kind of feeling weird. I wouldn't say it's painful just different.

__label__0 They were late. They tried to play it cool with the excuse they gave, but J had this grin on his face and Lux had the flushes look she gets when she has sex. And then Lux said she was going to fix her hair and left to the bathroom and after a while J said he was going to see if she needed help. Obviously they left to have sex. I mean, fine, but I thought that was a bit disrespectful.

I said I couldn't believe he would think it was possible that I might be that stupid. He insisted that he only asked me as a joke, and then I got angrier because in what world is questioning my ability to handle basic logic funny? He continued to go on the offensive insisting that he had been kidding, that of course he doesn't think I'm stupid at all, and how could I even think he would think that?

He insisted that he only asked me as a joke, and then I got angrier because in what world is questioning my ability to handle basic logic funny? He continued to go on the offensive insisting that he had been kidding, that of course he doesn't think I'm stupid at all, and how could I even think he would think that?

I have friends helping me with food and transportation because I am poor and disability aid is barely enough to eat a meal a day. I have food stamps that work for about a week or week and a half of groceries so that's already really helpful. I live in a small, worn down appartement with no heating and thays why I am so cold.

__label__1 I specifically told my father NOT to lose my money gambling. I'm not that depressed since I sort of expected this to happen, but I am still severely disappointed. I am literally continuing to lose respect for my own father. Of course, it isn't so much the money, but rather that he would do this to me when I told him not to. I fear that if this continues, my father will continue to waste away his own life as well as damage mine.

Long story short, something's flipped in my head the last couple of weeks and my libido is very much back, worryingly so, I'm not sure what to do with it lol. So we've had more sex in the past 7 days than the preceding 7 years....but it's still very much for him. I don't know what I want and I don't know how to ask for what I want. It's been so freaking long since I considered sex as a thing it actually makes me nervous.

__label__1 I apologized for taking up too much of his time and space and for not respecting his boundaries, and for storming off angry; the worst part is that he eventually said he didn't accept my apology because I was still ruining his day with my insistence he apologize for speaking to me with a "retarded" voice. So, is our relationship doomed?   ---   **tl;dr**: My bf and I fight too much, and I think it's both our faults while he thinks it's only mine/my brain chemistry's fault.

__label__0 Normally, my anxiety is very well controlled. I meditate every morning for \~15 minutes and have been in therapy for the better part of the last 3 or 4 years. I feel WAY better than I used to, and on a day to day basis things are great.

__label__1 Sure it was almost 3 years ago (in July) two months into my first job out of university. I got bit in the leg and continued on like it was nothing. I only fell apart October 2016. I must have been living in survival mode until I got the call that the man who saved my life was getting recognized with a bravery award. Hearing those words, I literally felt my chest rip open and haven't been able to close the wound since.

__label__0 There was no need for child care. When our daughter was 3, my husband, her father, taught her the word privacy. He then explained to her 3 yr old self what it means so she could understand. It was so cute when I would try and help her with her bath, and she would say "no mommy, I need my PRIVATY..LOL. we encouraged this as she got older.

__label__0 What is for you the most relatable portrayal you have seen/heard I don't have PTSD but reading a retired Marines blog I noticed that when he was talking about his PTSD it sounded a lot like Rick in the Walking Dead. Ill explain for those who have never seen it. Rick was the leader of his group during a zombie outbreak. He killed his best friend twice (technically) and his wife died along with most everyone he knew.

__label__0 I've been out of work for nine months, and it's finally catching up to me. When I lost my job in January, I took a sabbatical for a few months; it was necessary at the time. Hindsight being 20/20, I should have set up my phone with call blockers when the bill collectors began calling. I couldn't tell the difference between a potential employer and something which would stress me out given the slew of incoming calls with unknown numbers. During my time off I invested my time to build new skills, donating them to a gaming community, and hanging out for escapism to the point of obsession.

__label__0 Sometimes, when I finally got out of bed and stood up, I felt like "Ugh, *finally*". Still, it did not happen every morning, and even when it did, I still felt rested from the long sleep, so I thought no more of it. Also, they were never nightmares. Sadly, my body got habituated to the sleep-component of Mirtazapine after about five months, and my old warped sleep cycle slowly creeped back into my life. The only benefit left in the medicine was the mild mental cushioning it provided, but at the same time I started to suspect that what I needed wasn't cushioning but to make new constructive life decisions, that only I could make.

__label__0 Throwaway because my normal account is a common username for me.... Anyway, I've been in a lesbian relationship for near 7 years. The first 2 was long distance but then i moved from NY to TX to be with her. Everything was generally okay until we moved into a new apartment back in December. It isnt the best but its a roof over our heads and it's relatively cheap.

__label__1 I am currently only using 5-htp once a week, i get no benefit when i use it daily. I have also been working out which has inevitably eased my depression and made my anxiety more tolerable but its still obviously taking hold of my life. Well here i am at this present moment, I have been contemplating having a sit down with my parents and telling them about my depression (pretty sure they already know, they just don't want to adress it). It had been hard, my parents come home at 9:00 PM and don't want to be bothered with me. they go straight to their rooms and the only time they are willing to talk is when they tell me to clean.

__label__0 Things were so good again. Just like the beginning. Then the yelling comes back. I got really sick and had to go to the hospital and he refused to come and visit me when I was home. He told me I was dense for expecting him to come hang out with me when I have such a deadly disease (it was MRSA and not that deadly).

A much larger dog attacked Paige's (my friends dog) face and ripped off her lower jaw, to the point it was hanging down by just the remaining skin and fur that was attached. Paige went into a 24hr vet and had emergency surgery that allowed the jaw to be re-attached but the middle of the jaw (from canine tooth to canine tooth) had to be completely removed so Paige essentially has a large hole in her lower jaw now.

__label__0 I'm posting this one more time for anyone that didn't see it. Our location is in central Louisiana. A co-worker recently gave birth last week and her baby is in stable condition. She was initially told that her baby would have dwarfism and she was okay with that, as long as it was healthy. Later, they told her that her baby wouldn't survive at birth.

__label__0 I'm fine, or so I thought. All my issues with anger, alcohol abuse, frequent bouts of depression, difficulties focusing or concentrating at work, I attributed to my bipolar disorder, and that was all I worked on. I've tried so many different types of medications and combinations thereof, more than 10 for sure, and even underwent electro-convulsive therapy, but nothing helped. It was not until this past summer that I thought to try therapy, something I had actively avoided. I didn't think that talking about anything would affect my bipolar disorder, and I **really** didn't want to talk about my trauma.

__label__1 I do not know if I ought to, to be honest. I determined to quit drinking nine months ago, and have been sober seven weeks. But I never had any desire to quit grass, and I still don't. But I am in trauma therapy for the last four months, and my therapist has brought it up a number of times. She keeps saying it affects my motivation and depression, but it helps with bot the GAD and social anxiety.

__label__1 I want to be able to deal with these feelings and move on. I’ve talked briefly to a counsellor on the phone but besides talking about it making me cry, it hasn’t made me feel better. This is one of the worst PTSD episodes of my life. I can’t predict how long this is going to go on and I’m sick of the weak, dissolving feeling I get whenever I think about it. I’ve been trying to replace bad thoughts with good, I’ve tried CBT techniques, I’ve tried wallowing in the bad thoughts (as advised by someone over at r/emetophobia)... nothing has worked, I’m a mess.

__label__1 So what I am asking is someone or somebody's to help me with the rest of the repair cost. The repair is 575 dollars, I have about 200 of that currently, I need to get this done soon before I am stuck on the side of the road with a broken down vehicle and spending unnecessary money on Ubers or Lyft. I'm willing to pay back monthly with acceptable interest until it's paid in full. I get paid bi-weekly at my full time job. Thanks in advance!

He even tried to marry me at 16 so he could trap me in his perverted hell. After four months of completely breaking free of this sick, twisted human being he had the gall to contact one of my friends to try to get a vinyl back. He treated me like a dog.

__label__1 But recently I went on a car journey with my friends and 5 minutes before we got to the destination I started panicking because I thought I needed a wee and took a valium (completely embarrassed myself in-front of my friends). once we got to the destination I was actually fine and didn't really need one that bad. Since then it keeps happening, like I was on the train and 1 stop before my destination I got off and walked because I started panicking. then today really got to me because I needed to get a bus that goes through a tunnel to go to the pub that takes 10 mins and I physically couldn't get on the bus because of this fear. I'm so annoyed at myself that this is starting to control my life.

__label__0 Hey guys, I'm not homeless myself, I'm just after some advice. Basically, I work in a restaurant that closes late so I'm often not back to my apartment complex until around midnight. For the last few nights when I come back, I've noticed a homeless person sleeping between the glass front at the ground floor entrance and the back of the stairwell... This doesn't particularly bother me because I figured he's just sleeping and all the individual apartments have locks on the doors anyway. However I could understand if others in my complex would be distressed or anxious by this, especially if they live on the first floor (I'm fortunate to live higher up on the fourth floor).

__label__0  But 19 and 39? to me I feel like that is someone older than my current age dating an age that seems like a child to me....  I creeped her facebook and she appears to be a " normal" 23 year old...going out partying...saying things I would have found funny at that age but cringe at now.....and he did share with me that he supported her for the most part and so on...I asked if she had any " life skills" and his answer was "  not really".  What are people's thoughts on this?   ---

__label__1 I don't know who I'm meant to talk to but I can't breathe. I can barely get out of bed or check my phone without panicking. But I'm always checking my phone in case someone messages me. I don't have it on loud because I don't like the noise. Yet my job requires me to always be reachable and the staff under me always ask me to help them, but I can't even help myself.

__label__0 She requested to go to the bathroom right away, and we helped her with that. The husband/driver was out loading all our parts when she finally came out of the bathroom. We asked her what is wrong. She said, "He grabbed me by the neck and hurt me. I don't think I can go back with him."

__label__1 My problems started after my first panic attack which had happened in October. After that I had a lot of anxiety about my heart (bp 140/90) I was medicated with Zoloft for a while, it helped but I didn't want to become dependent on it and I had a lot of side effects. My bp with Zoloft was around 120/70 After some weeks the anxiety came back with horror, fear of the death and lump in a neck, stiffness in chest. My blood thyroid hormones were measured, everything's perfect.

__label__1 This has begun to bother me since I do try to please her and go out of my way to have a little foreplay but she never really returns that favor. It has become a one sided physical relationship. I've even had multiple times where I have trouble getting it up, and its largely due to the fact that I receive no physical stimulation prior to intercourse. We've known each other a year and been officially dating for about 9 months. I finally decided to say something a month ago because it was really beginning to bother me because I'd hoped she'd slowly overcome these fears with time but she seems to be content with how things were and not going to change.

__label__0 I waited a bit and then went and talked to our advisor. I vaguely and briefly explained what happened so I could get his help in understanding some procedures I didn't understand. We went down to the lab and figured out my work together. I was then standing and doing something with my samples while my advisor was doing something else in the room. Then I suddenly looked up toward the door and entirely expected my fellow student to burst in yelling about how I told our advisor.

__label__1 Every day I wake up doing nothing. Absolutely nothing except wasting my life, hoping something would happen but of course nothing would happen because I am a lonely fuck who pushes away everyone in his life while everyone else goes out and party like there is no tomorrow and fuck and cum like they are in a porno and make memories that not even one memory book is enough. Every day I wake up doing nothing. Either wasting my time playing videogames or watching the social media status scrolling up and up and up when in reality, i am doing absolutely nothing. Nothing is being absorbed in that stupid brain of mine, wherever the hell it is when I should be doing something more productive like studying or reading but either my own brain rotted to the size of a pea *(because of how mental disorders degenerate brain cells ... yay me, I am doing something at all)* or it just felt and flew up to Mars, or it is sitting its dark throne,  rubbing its pitchfork,  planning its next move on how to fuck me, both literally and figuratively.

__label__1 It's late and I should be sleeping but I can't get my husband out of my head, he's just such a freaking weirdo. I feel alone in my situation because most abuse involves some level of anger, but for me my suffering was just his way of showing me affection.  He would always love to wrestle and tickle torture me, and he wouldn't stop when I was screaming at him to stop I no longer live with him but even today I still get a little flinchy. I lived in fear of being tackled, pinned, and tickled on a routine basis. I resent him for making me feel so small and fearful and at the same time he made me feel like I was crazy, that I was overreacting.

__label__1 When I was living with people I would stand behind the door and wait for it to be quiet before I step out of my room. It makes me so anxious to have to talk to people. It didn’t help that one of them would play loud music all day so I would put in my headphones and go to sleep until he has stopped. I was so anxious and depressed that semester, it really affected my grades. Anyway, today was my first time seeing someone for help about my anxiety and I did not know what to expect at all.

I'm sick of the city, I'm considering a rural life of self sustainability and have adequate means for finding financing to a farm of some sort. Would a homeless scholarship program work for people? Self sustainable life with access to counselling and all food and board paid for help?

Stomach ache, uneasiness, some sort of dread, or feeling like any little thing would bring me over the edge and have a panic attack. I don't understand why and it can last for a long time. Anyways. Sometimes the breathing exercises help take the edge off it, but it doesn't fully help.

__label__1 All these sexual abuse accusations, while wonderful to see so many men and women coming forward about sexual abuse, I just can't escape it. So much victim blaming, the increasingly clear proof that many men do not actually understand what consent means, it's just too much. I haven't left the apartment in days and the only reliable form of self medication is too expensive (weed). I'm also autistic so I've noticed it's also overstimulating me to the point I'm hiding. It's just too much and I thank you for reading my vent.

So much victim blaming, the increasingly clear proof that many men do not actually understand what consent means, it's just too much. I haven't left the apartment in days and the only reliable form of self medication is too expensive (weed). I'm also autistic so I've noticed it's also overstimulating me to the point I'm hiding. It's just too much and I thank you for reading my vent.

__label__0 Not like triggers per say, because I'd have to ask her about that, but more general behaviors. Like, if I see her acting in a certain way that is common to abuse victims, I should know to be careful around that. Like apologizing a lot is a common behavior. Knowing about the abuse, I didn't try and correct her or anything (save one time when she thought she was bothering me, and I told her she will never be able to do that). So any additional information is useful.

__label__0 Everyone loved him. He told the best stories and cooked the best food and was funny. All my friends thought he was the coolest person ever. He also has untreated bipolar disorder. Anyway - back in December he hit her so bad (using an object) that the next day she passed out at work and her coworkers forced her to get medial attention ) - she went the hospital - her sister went to meet her - and because it was mentioned that a minor lived in the house - social workers and the police got involved.

__label__1 My boyfriend and I generally have a good relationship. We've lived together for about a year and a half, and we have a pretty good partnership going. He's the first guy I've been with who is willing to sit down and really hash things out if we're having an issue. However there is one topic he *won't* hash out with me, and that's that sometimes he asks me questions out of no where that to me feel kind of like little "pop quizzes" that I feel are designed to try to catch me off guard and stump me. He'll randomly pose a riddle or ask a logic question, then I kind of fumble because I feel like I have to come up with an answer quickly, or I just get exasperated and tell him I'm not in the mood for a pop quiz.

__label__0 Anybody ever have this happen? I have no history whatsoever of reacting to peanut butter, and even have had a full panel allergy test a few years ago that confirmed that I'm not (but I'm allergic to every pollen known to man apparently lol). I used to eat peanut butter sandwiches for lunch all the time. My favorite candy used to be Reese's peanut butter cups, and I have even eaten one in the past few months. I ate a pint of peanut butter ice cream no problem.

__label__1 When I try to befriend artists or thinkers or doers. They often either shun me because my work has been sub par and nearly non existant and they don't see me as equal. Or they show sexual/romantic interest I don't reciprocate which makes me nervous and avoidant. Sometimes I am shunmed I think because they mistake my interest in making friends for a romantic interest. I am quite annoyed by all the assumptions/game playing/projecting that goes on in the world.

__label__0 My Grandma;s commercial was one in which her Clorox is taken from her and she has to wash her clothes for a month without using any Clorox. The only thing that she remembers for sure was that she quotes “my babysitter Mary says that the clothes aren’t as clean,” or something to that effect... BTW if the commercial is produced, I am willing to give some reddit gold, or pay money via paypal, whichever is preferred ;\) Thanks in advance, \-Kyle

__label__1 Cut to yesterday... My parents booked me in for an emergency appointment with the DR because my anxiety and depression is so bad I cannot function day to day and spend most of my time stuck in bed panicking. I was prescribed 2mg Valium to go alongside my anti-depressants. I took one and within 15 minutes I went from SEVERE anxiety to COMPLETE calmness Well... here comes the paranoia associated with my bad cannabis trip years ago... I FREAKED.

__label__0 He also said that Brian's mother made comments like she hopes she gets hit by a bus and she's so depressed because I'm doing this to her. (No mention has ever been made by them how much our daughter is having to miss out on by having this medical issue let alone what their own son is being put through from their lack of respect.) The other problem is, I genuinely believe Brian's father wants a relationship with our daughter. The fact that we're withholding her from their toxic behavior right now might be a turning point for him to grow a pair in his own marriage. I'm not holding my breath, but I have a little bit of hope.

He’s temperamental, out of work, depressed, has a family history of substance abuse, and was recently diagnosed with bipolar 2. I truly believed this would be “rock bottom” and serve as a wake up call to turn his life around. It wasn’t.

Slowly, we began seeing more of each other and the relationship turned physical. We both live in the Pacific Northwest, but he's going to be moving to his hometown in the southeast at the end of this month. I'm moving to the southwest next month.

__label__1 I don't know if I'm able to do that, since I didn't tell the doctor the truth to begin with. I will say that my doctor very clearly didn't believe me at my follow up appointment, but my bf was in the waiting room. So I didn't admit to anything. I was teary eyed, however. From anyone's experience- is it worth it to go to the police?

__label__1 Hi everyone, This is my first post in this thread, so bear with me. My mother (54F) has always been controlling and anxious, and now that I (19F) have gone to college, it feels like things have gotten worse. I am home right now for winter break and things have been so tense and awful and I don't know what to do. She is really judgmental and anxious about my sex life.

__label__1 But I still froze and cried through the entire thing. Some of the sensations brouvht me to memories of old sensations, andI felt really vulnerable, trapped, and ashamed, and I haven't been able to shake it off all day. Part of it is that we have company staying in our home; so I don't feel like I have the space to care for myself, and it just further perpetuates the shame feeling. In fact, I felt too ashamed to go home right after, and drove around for an hour and a half before I felt like I at least i wouldn't have to explain myself to my boyfriend's family. Additionally, because it's my boyfriend's family, my boyfriend has been unavailable to me all day.

Some of the sensations brouvht me to memories of old sensations, andI felt really vulnerable, trapped, and ashamed, and I haven't been able to shake it off all day. Part of it is that we have company staying in our home; so I don't feel like I have the space to care for myself, and it just further perpetuates the shame feeling. In fact, I felt too ashamed to go home right after, and drove around for an hour and a half before I felt like I at least i wouldn't have to explain myself to my boyfriend's family.

__label__1 I have therapy sessions scheduled but at the moment, I'm currently looking for some advice and insights. The only time I feel 'comfortable in my own skin' is when I'm drunk and or stoned. I, in the past have been ridiculed for an effeminate walk, been erroneously suspected of being gay and I have an effate look. Perhaps this facial look is a projection of my despair and a subconscious psychosomatic cry for help. I'm in my late twenties and have yet to accomplish anything of significance.

__label__0 Was the entire hood in the world trying to off me? What’s going on? Those are the thoughts of my mind every time something like that happens and it wasn’t the first time I’ve heard, “God does everything for a reason.” A while back, when I had a home a man needed a way home with his old man, and asked me to drive the old man’s car because the old guy was too drunk to drive and the young thug didn’t have a license. Of course I said hell yeah, he’s got his pops with him… and I’d miss driving, and good karma.

__label__1 I've been through treatment and had a period of relative health for a stretch. Then I had a bunch of new trauma experiences. I'm 5 or so years out from the last experiences and have moved 800 miles away, completely cut off from all former contacts with the exception of one close friend. The move helped for a while, then it hit with vengeance. Panic attacks, ruminating, depression, anger, the whole deal.

__label__1 And one of the girls pull me and asks me if I like him and I said yeah and she goes “if you like him you can have him because my friend is only here for one night...(gets pulled).

So I leave the club go home on the train with the worst feeling ever, more insecure than I’ve ever been. **tl;dr : one of the worst feelings I’ve ever had in my life (sorry for being dramatic)**

__label__0 But three days ago they put his dad on the morphine drip. He is watching his dad die in the same slow manner he watched my mom. The hospice nurses (oddly the same ones who saw my mom out) have turned his oxygen up to 5 and understandably my dad doesn't want to leave his side. So here we are I'm about to call my job for the second day and beg for a ride or not to get fired. My husbands parents are sort of helping him but still leaving it up in the air everyday before he is supposed to be at work.

__label__1 Bottom line is this is the first situation in a long while causing me to really get anxious. I'm thinking about it most of the time and waffling about it. And today I got the invitation and started looking into flights and transport and I'm overwhelmed. I'm at an age where traveling alone shouldn't be a big deal, but it is, I never have traveled alone aside from a handful of 2 hr bus trips in 2007ish. Any advice?

__label__1 Bottom line is this is the first situation in a long while causing me to really get anxious. I'm thinking about it most of the time and waffling about it.

__label__0 Okay so a bit of background, me and my girlfriend are in our second year of college (my subjects make a freshman though hehe) and have been together for 6 months. I want to be an ambassador and she wants to go into marketing. Every day we spend time together, there isn't a moment where the two of us don't end up talking about our future. To be more specific, we always end up talking extensively about marriage, what to name our daughter, how many golden retrievers to get and the like. Don't get me wrong, I love her to bits and I enjoy talking to her about these things, it's just that I'm slightly worried that maybe she is in love with the idea of me, and I with the idea of her.

Through rain, sleet, snow, and sunshine she was in the stands proudly cheering him on. In their own little world they were in love.

I go way down the rabbithole, sometimes, wondering if I am crazy and nothing happened and my ex was right, because there are so many things I can't remember, now.

__label__0 If I pursue this research, would you be interested in participating? How much time would you be willing to give (asking because a survey might take up to 30minutes, but an interview can take up to 2 hours)? Would you prefer to be surveyed or interviewed (it would likely be a phone interview)? If I did a survey, it would probably still include some open-ended questions (that you are free to leave a few sentences of a few page worth of a response to) so I can still hear directly from you. Feel free to answer these questions in the comments, or dm me.

If I did a survey, it would probably still include some open-ended questions (that you are free to leave a few sentences of a few page worth of a response to) so I can still hear directly from you. Feel free to answer these questions in the comments, or dm me.

__label__0 I made way to the store, it was full of like the whole fucking town. Turns out it was like this nearly every night, feeling good I decided to make conversation with the guy at the register. I was curious as to what happened to that other convenience store. Considering there was only two in the whole area, both in good spots, you wouldn’t think it would just go out of business. Nah something was off.

Even now as I type this I hear him out there waiting for me saying Daddy Daddy Daddy. He comes and gives me hugs when I come home and barely notices when my wife is gone or comes home. - ‎This is also something she's recently admitted and I feel guilty about it, but I feel like it's because she puts in no effort beyond what she needs to do.

__label__0 As I'm sitting there patiently, I can hear the receptionist and her friend chatting about all sorts of things, fixing their hair, laughing. Finally I called my fiancé to tell him what was going on - I think I've been "forgotten" (the waiting room is off to the side out of view of the reception area). I was feeling very anxious to confront her and ask if she had forgotten about me because I did not want to get in a scuttle as I remember her temper from my last visit. As my fiance is on the phone helping me build up the courage to talk to her, the doctor walks out to the reception area visible to me, coat on, laptop in hand, ready to call it a night. I see him point to me and ask his wife what I'm waiting on.

__label__0 Neither one at all my fault but thanks for thinking it is. :) I have plenty of value regardless of my relationship status or if something shitty has befallen me or not.   tl;dr We broke up. If dude is so in love with his solitude he can have it, if he's so worried about resentment and arguments he doesn't have to worry about those either. Maybe next time he'll think about what he wants and is willing to do before he opens his mouth.

__label__1 I'm so used to being forced to submit to him that I no longer have a voice. He heavily favors my sister over me and would buy her anything she wanted in a heartbeat. An example would be at Darvin furniture one time. He takes me and my sister there and tells her to pick out a desk. I look at a $100 discount desk and he says we don't have enough money.

__label__0 Hello, I am a long long long time user of Paxil and am looking to try something different. It works well for me, but i have been taking it for 17years. I have put on about 120 lbs over those years, some due to age, but I blame paxil for a majority. I also am not as energetic as I used to be, and noticed the decline shortly after going on it. But since it worked so well i ignored it.

I have put on about 120 lbs over those years, some due to age, but I blame paxil for a majority. I also am not as energetic as I used to be, and noticed the decline shortly after going on it. But since it worked so well i ignored it.

__label__1 I can't stop the ruminating thoughts about the whole process. I also can't stop the what if's or I should have done more. I keep blaming myself and beating myself up. It sometimes makes me physically sick. Do you have any tips to help alleviate the pain and stop the thoughts?

__label__1 They are very sweet and welcoming to me, but I feel so overwhelmed with everything. I feel as though I gave up my independence to come here, which is fine, but I'm having a really hard time adjusting to everything being handed to me when I've had to provide for myself for so long. I told my boyfriend that I need supplies for the week and he responded with "ask my mom". I couldn't wrap my mind around that. I still cant.

__label__0 The room would be free, along with internet access and a bed provided until you got on your feet. Once you are stable, we would, of course, expect you to chip in a bit. We have gigabit internet in the house, several flat screens, central air, and access to pretty much every streaming service you could want, as well as a shared steam library of about 1400 games. If we mesh well, you can stay for quite awhile, or if you want to move out once you have a stable job and an apartment lined up, we can help you move. PM me if you are interested, and I will reach out so we can get to know you.

__label__0 I wouldn't say I'm a generally anxious person, but I have severe anxiety when it comes to my living space. I've lived alone in various apartments for a few years now, and I don't ever let people come over. I'm pretty messy, but not anything extreme enough to justify keeping people away. My boyfriend has only been over a handful of times and I do my best to rush him out. I'll go out of my way to keep people out.

__label__0 I am 25 years old, suffered from anxiety for about 10 years or so. Anxiety used to stop me from being able to leave the house unless with my parents or boyfriend.

__label__1 Most of 2017, I stayed at around 135 and have been really good about hiding my fat with very flattering clothes but over the last 3 months, I have gained 15lbs as a result of traveling for work, moving to a new city and the holidays. I have always been very unhappy with the way I look and I envy girls who are slim. I obsess about this in my head 24/7 and even though I try to stay positive, the truth about how I REALLY feel comes out almost every time I go out drinking with friends and I become extremely negative and sometimes cry alone. My bf has told me that he is unhappy with my weight and he also hates seeing me unhappy. A summary of my bf: he is a complete workaholic, he loves me to death, he tells me how beautiful I am every day, he has dumped me 3 times because of my weight, he thinks I am an excuse maker and he does not know if he will commit to me.

__label__1 Anyway, I feel like maybe I should talk to someone, but I have no idea how to even bring it up with my doctor. How does that work? Do I just march in and say "Hey Dr, I think maybe I have PTSD."? Just sounds weird. EDIT: Also want to throw in here that I'm not interested in being medicated

__label__0 Quick background: I left this guy back in 2006 after three years, and also turned him in for possession of child pornography and talking to a tween online and getting nudes from her. He plead guilty to Sexual Exploitation of a Minor, avoided federal charges but was put on the sex offender registry in that state. I just found out that he died in March of this year. Stage 4 cancer. It had metastasized by the time they found it, nothing they could do.

__label__1 She humiliates me in front of other people and when we're alone. I'm always just a servant who's there to get her drinks and hype her up. I'm always just the butt of her jokes. She used to invite me over when she was hanging out with a guy she was trying to hook up with, just so she could make fun of me in front of him the whole time to make herself look better and/or cooler. I'm just a prop.

__label__0 Asked for a little extension. She won’t provide it. I should be able to graduate in December. My academic counselor is looking to help me graduate around some of the program, so I hate to bring my concerns up higher or file with disability. My trauma therapist wants me to advocate higher up.

__label__1 We were hoping to call when he leaves for work today-he’s leaving in about 15 minutes. I’m really scared and I think he’ll continue to come after us even after he goes to jail so we’re probably going to have to get a restraining order. Considering we’re a financially unstable family this is going to majorly impact the way we live. We live in a two bedroom apartment so we’re probably going to have to move to a studio or anything else that’s cheaper. My brother leaves in 2 days because he has to go back to college and we need to take action when he’s here because me and my mom can’t really go against my dad (physically).

__label__1 We ate and he was monitoring my data use because I sent some photos to our friend of her baby shower. And he said he "hates having to watch over me like a father and he wishes I was more responsible" but said that he "accepts that this is the way I am" I said nothing in response to this and just ate my food and let it slide, smiled at him and small talked. We got back to the park and they had put out a new sign saying they were closed for the rest of the day. This made him even more mad.

__label__0 and how that would intersect with a potential partner’s attitude. You’ve probably seen the posts on here: a woman gave birth four months ago and her husband is pissed off because her breasts are sore and he can’t play with them. A woman gave birth three months ago and her husband is pressuring her for PiV sex even though she is still uncomfortable. A woman doesn’t enjoy sexual play with her breasts anymore after breastfeeding because it’s a mammary gland and not a sex organ, and the husband gets pissed because he wants to touch her breasts and apparently isn’t aware of other erogenous zones. These were posts I remember reading on here for some relevant examples, but I can go on.

__label__0 Well I guess it was my second. Last week we set the ground work for the safe space to come back to if things got too overwhelming. This week we began to work through my trauma. Starting out the session was definitely very strange. I wasn’t sure what answers my therapist was looking for but once she assured me that there were no wrong answers everything went fine.

__label__0 I'm leaning more toward not responding but I haven't been able to let it go. I'm not sure what she even wanted, other than to talk to me before make a big decision for and her kids. I got a message pleading for a conversation, no explanation as to what. She apologized and stated that she wasn't trying to cause problems. She said he was in prison for something that happened a long time ago (looks like he was on felony probation and did something to get it revoked), sent pictures of her children, who are all one year older than the children him and I share, and told me his mother had passed.

__label__0 Things between us were amicable until that point. Now, the atmosphere is VERY different. It hurts now because she's acting indifferent and like she's totally unaffected (which she might well be, I don't know if she's pretending). Shes already moved on to someone else, someone she's liked for a while, her boss. She has tried three times to bring her up and talk to me about her.

__label__1 My girlfriend does have PTSD. She said that she thought that I might have it because of an incident that occurred in 2014. You can read about it in my post history but basically I was placed on an involuntary psychiatric hold for pretty much no reason, the therapists responsible for it just covered themselves up and lied about it. It greatly affected me. I would definitely consider it to be a traumatic event, not just because of the actual events that transpired and the conditions of the hospital (which are pretty bad) but also just the huge betrayal of trust.

__label__1 I have never before felt so betrayed by the system. Fiance (f) was blackout drunk. She started getting physical by grabbing my genitals and pulling so hard I now have a 1.5" tear in my scrotum.. after that I was punched, bitten, scratched, and kicked over the next 5 minutes. All I could do was try to retreat, but I was unable to get to our room so I could get dressed and leave the house (I was nude at the time). As I got scared she would seriously hurt me, or I would strike her back, I grabbed my phone and dialed 911.

__label__0 I'm sure as other survivors many of you are overcoming some of the same problems as well, and may have already had some of these realizations (of what makes you YOU) or are in search of them on your journey to becoming whole. It is crazy how DEEP these emotional scars and wounds are, that I literally cried way harder in this session, than in even processing waking up in a hospital bald! In this memory, I had post-partum depression right after my son was born and was living with Nmom and my Edad when they were still married 8 years ago. (I'm so grateful that they are no longer married. He is such an excellent parent/person NOW that he doesn't care about "undermining her".)

__label__1 I even pressed chargers against him. Unfortunately he still found a way through to me by hooking up with girls that I know and having them make sure I knew about it. Nothing has happened since June and I’m about to be moving far away from him. I struggle with what he did to me every day and the flashbacks occur still. I don’t expect this to ever fully go away but I am 18 now and I can say that I survived this.

__label__1 I have been reluctant to start one of these as I am really ashamed to ask for help. One of my dear friends suggested I do this as I really do not have anywhere else to ask for assistance right now. I am at a high risk for homelessness. Landlord now wants me out unless I can come up with $800 in the next couple of days. I also was recently kicked off of food stamps lately for no apparent reason and I am working to get that fixed.

__label__1 As much of an asshole I know it makes me, I simply can't put my heart into a relationship in which I know I'm not the father of her child. I was ghosted this past summer by one of few people I've ever wanted to have a relationship with, and the subsequent weeks were a quest to find sex that would distract me from the pain. Others came before, but she's the first to actually show interest in the long term. She's made these ambitious plans for our distant future, and I don't have it in my heart to tell her it'll never happen. She's the first girl to show me daily how much she cares for me, and the impending thought of breaking her heart is killing me.

__label__0 When I was 16 I met a guy on vacation 11 years my senior... Having never been able to get along with those in my age group, I thought nothing of somebody older spending time with me, as I had grown up always spending my time around the adults during the holidays or my older brother's friends... Looking back now, I know this was naive and innocent on my part, nothing that anyone could or should blame a young kid for, as I really thought I was an outcast amongst my peers. And while it may have been true, there is no reason or excuse for a 27 year old man to want to be with a 16 year old girl except that he couldn't find a woman his age who would fall for his games and lies... He played nice for my vacation-- respecting my boundaries and acting only as a friend. He showed me the island and was nothing but kind and hospitable to my family...

Looking back now, I know this was naive and innocent on my part, nothing that anyone could or should blame a young kid for, as I really thought I was an outcast amongst my peers. And while it may have been true, there is no reason or excuse for a 27 year old man to want to be with a 16 year old girl except that he couldn't find a woman his age who would fall for his games and lies... He played nice for my vacation-- respecting my boundaries and acting only as a friend. He showed me the island and was nothing but kind and hospitable to my family...

__label__1 so i finally got tired of being anxious and depressed, crying daily, not leaving the house a few months ago and decided it was time to see a doctor again. I would only leave to work, and couldnt hold a job very long due to the anxiety(eventually stop going after successfully alienating myself from everyone) and went to see a psychiatrist. He started me on 40mg of fluoxetine and 50mg atenolol a day with 1mg lorazepam 3x daily as needed. I averaged about 2 of the lorazepam a day, some days 3 some days 1 or even 0, and 1 time i took 4(christmas with the family, not all at once but over the course of the evening) I went back after about 2 and a half months and he increased my atenolol to 100mg and switched me to .5mg alprazolam 1x a day(from the past i knew this wouldnt be an effective dose but he wouldnt listen) For the 2 and a half months i felt like i was leading a normal life, doing well in school, seeing friends again, working, going on dates(have a girlfriend who understands my anxiety and we met when  i was drinking to deal with it so this is the worst shes ever seen me and wants me to find a new doctor) interacting with my family and not hiding in my room all day. With the switch to xanax ive gone back to my old ways of hiding away, crying, not eating, and have almsot purchased cigarettes again(quit smoking about 10 months ago).

__label__0 Hi everyone, I'm not sure if this goes here or under parenting. I met "Bob" in a big city, moved with him to his parents property to start a business/farm. He immediately went into 30,000 debt building an unnecessary smithy and had to get a job so we couldn't start the business after all. I bought a used car so I could get out sometimes and look for a job, he took the car to work (instead of his retired parent's car as planned) so I was stuck at home again. I got pregnant, we got married.

__label__0 thought, if its not going to listen to me talk, I'll send an easy to read article (they literally listed the differences in bullet points) and a video. Still ignored it. I've also adopted the Eleven's "no second chances" policy from Doctor Who. Later in the night, I sent a text that basically said told it to be more supportive and actively listen (communication, bitch), or I can't continue to be around it. I went to sleep and woke up to it saying, "fine, I guess we'll see other people, then!"

__label__1 Does anyone have any advice? I feel pretty hopeless right now. I want desperately to be with my partner, and I suspect even if our relationship ends I will always love and care for him very much. I don't want to spend my life wishing I was with him, but be too overcome with my anxiety and fear to do so. It is discouraging to feel as though my ex-boyfriend is still inside my head and controlling my life.

__label__0 Hey guys, I was watching Seth Meyers and he made a joke about the longest pizza event. I did some research and it will be on June 10th at the Fontana speedway in California. There will be over a mile of pizza and it needs to be eaten to count towards the record. This is a free event. I was thinking that this is somewhat related to the random acts of pizza lifestyle.

__label__0 then i tried an ep of bojack horseman on my tablet, but it didn’t really help. for ex, after it was over, i still had my tablet on for light and i was staring up at the ceiling when the ceiling and the wall behind me started to ripple weirdly, distorting, and then the tablet light went off abruptly and i startled and yelped and quickly turned it back on! i also felt someone sit on my bed next to me when i tried to leave the light off and sleep. i distinctly felt it. i didn't hear distant voices like the other time i was this 'hypervigilant,' but i heard some small noise rustle in the closet (just a house noise i assume) and it unnerved me.

__label__1 My main thing lately is that everything is making me feel overwhelmed and stressed out even in non-stressful situations, just every day life. I have a good life that is a lot less stressful than most but it seems to cause me a lot more stress than it would to anyone else like my wife for example. I feel like I'm always on the edge and my head is going to explode in angry/frustration over nothing at all. I've been checked out many times, full blood work and other tests and everything perfect with my health as far as my Dr is concerned. I've always had an idea in my head that I would do anything and everything to avoid taking medications and I've been convinced that I can deal with this on my own and if I can't then I'm doing something wrong.
__label__1 My main thing lately is that everything is making me feel overwhelmed and stressed out even in non-stressful situations, just every day life. I have a good life that is a lot less stressful than most but it seems to cause me a lot more stress than it would to anyone else like my wife for example. I feel like I'm always on the edge and my head is going to explode in angry/frustration over nothing at all.

__label__1 I've told her each time to stop, she apologised but doesn't see what the big deal is because she "hasn't been in love with me for a long time." This is when I started to feel awful. I can't fully figure out why though because Im not in love with her - I probably hate her and haven't realised it yet. I just feel terrible. I can barely get out of bed to go to uni.

__label__0 I just felt it was best to separate them for the time, at least until he hopefully calmed down. I had asked someone else in the group--without informing them of what had transpired--to direct the male back to the cars so we could leave. But the male had run off. So while everyone else went back to a mutual friend's house, I drove around looking for him. I found him sitting outside a gas station a little up the road.

__label__0 I sat her down and told her that she is ruining her chances of having a relationship with my husband by how strong she is coming on. I told her that she is pushing him away and making him uncomfortable. She seemed to take that to heart but then days later said, “this is just who I am.”  I've been working on ways to fix this; it just isn’t very successful. I will take my mom to therapy with me when our schedules work. **TONIGHT:**

__label__0 She’s so sweet and gentle such that a complete stranger can reach into her mouth and take food away and she won’t even react. But she sometimes tries to grab food off the table if people aren’t around. MIL has been with us for several months now and tells us she loves spending time with the baby. She has her own room. I cook all the meals and my wife does most of the laundry.

__label__1 I’ve had a some fucked shit happen to me. I'm not going into detail because I'm not looking for sympathy. Today is the last day I have to pay or quit. I don’t have anyone to help and I’ve exhausted all my other options applying for loans, pawning things, etc. I need to somehow come up with 1,490.46 by 6 pm.

__label__0 I went on a week long Mexico vacation with my BF of 5 months, and she tried to sit me down and have a conversation about how if I got pregnant I would ruin my life (I had to teach myself all about those things because she preferred to ignore it, it's a good thing I enjoy research). Now that I've decided to move in with my BF when I move back to my hometown, I don't even know how or when I should bring this one up. She treats me as if I am a child who doesn't think things through on normal small decisions, this is going to be a nightmare. A little information on my own thought process and my relationship. I am a very pragmatic person, but also very independent.

__label__0 So long story short I’m currently a freshman and my mom has made it clear that I’m being kicked out before the start of my sophomore year. I plan on making my way to New York City and living on the streets while looking for a job under the table. I am hoping to find somebody willing to hire me for a construction//landscaping job. My goal is to save money while going to high school, so that I can get my diploma and start a career in law enforcement. Of course my mom didn’t think to take note to save anything such as my birth certificate or the like...

__label__0 I tend not to like driving long distances in cars with people in unfamiliar places still but I feel good just that I am back on the road even if I don't drive the car. This took me about five years to reach this level of comfort. All of my fears:  I started to exercise hard every single day. Heavy exercise would defeat the fear in most cases or make it easy to manage. If I did not exercise, I was a walking fear bomb.

__label__1 So now they are querying whether he has a traumatic brain injury suffered a year before we got together and that now he has progressing brain damage. At this point my nurse self kicks in, I can't not help someone in that situation. I feel sorry for him I don't want him to be hurt or alone. But I also want to hate him and leave. So my incredibly long winded question to you is this: if he has brain damage is this an excuse or a reason?

__label__0 Things with my foster parents were reaching a breaking point, so I finally ran away from home. I've never gone back, and never will go back. I'd rather die than go back into a cage. I skipped the last month of my college semester, didn't bother going to the finals, and just relaxed in the downtown area of the city I lived near.

I skipped the last month of my college semester, didn't bother going to the finals, and just relaxed in the downtown area of the city I lived near. I still had my job, so I was just relaxing and enjoying my newfound freedom.

I know that I am anxious all the time and terrified of fucking up and I know for sure that the more anxious I am, the more I cannot focus well and think straight and the more likely it is for me to fuck up .. and somehow, everytime I do, I feel like I just want to belittle myself so much that I deliberately and purposefully want to see myself covered in blood and bruises because I feel like I deserve it! !

__label__1 So a bit of long back story here, I was adopted as a child not a proper legal adoption, there was a residency order for me to live with my aunt and uncle for an underdetermined amount of time, after a year my aunt and uncle split and my uncle kept me (my aunt was the one I was actually related to) social services never really got involved past this point. My uncle/ adoptive father started dating a woman that I would come to know as my mum (I always knew they weren’t biological) They had a very destructive relationship and my adoptive father was incredibly abusive towards her (like attempted stabbing & trying to set her on fire in front of me) he was never abusive towards me in fact he treated me like I was untouchable which fostered resentment between me and my “mum” They eventually spilt when I was 18 (9 years ago) and I’ve not spoken to my dad since,my mum works in a hospital and just informed me that he was admitted to the ward she works on and potentially has lung cancer. My mum is practically gleeful about it being cosmic karma for him being a horrible person but I’m uncomfortable with how happy she is that he’s ill, I’ve not really spoken to her about it because she’s the one that suffered not me so I can’t really tell her how to deal but it just seems a bit much to me to be happy.

Eventually he decided to close up for the night and I went back up to the house, tipsy and confused about what had just happened, but glad I had bargained some time. I got myself on the dole and the rope that was against my neck seemed to loosen just a little bit. However I was still in the prison of depression and plagued by self-destructive tendencies. Although I had some more regular income I would often binge on the euphoria of having money (I was still a teenager after all), spend too much in my mania and then quickly sink into paranoia and avoidance when rent day came along.

__label__0 Oh, I forgot Aversives. This is where the therapist is openly punitive, hostile or withholding, explicitly, in order to punish and teach you. Linehan gives three sentences towards ant ethical criticism of this, by saying it works. It also uses fun techniques like giving multiple sessions a week, plus groups, which are mandatory. There is also telephone contact.

__label__0 They're all things I enjoy doing and don't see as being that big of a deal, but she seems to perceive them as grand gestures. She regularly says that she "doesn't deserve" someone as "perfect" as me (which yes, she does, she's amazing, and also I'm not even that great, just moderately thoughtful) and has also said that "because of past experiences, I have trouble liking people who I know like me... I guess it's more rewarding to feel like I've "earned" the validation." In short, it seems like because of her past relationships, she kind of has an unhealthy mentality around 'earning' affection, and definitely has some sort of commitment issues (apparently her last ex said that he didn't really love her for the last year of their relationship, but was too afraid of hurting her to break up with her). All of this makes me ambivalent about broaching the topic of a committed relationship with her because I don't know how she'll react, but at this point we've both admitted we're falling for each other.

She regularly says that she "doesn't deserve" someone as "perfect" as me (which yes, she does, she's amazing, and also I'm not even that great, just moderately thoughtful) and has also said that "because of past experiences, I have trouble liking people who I know like me... I guess it's more rewarding to feel like I've "earned" the validation." In short, it seems like because of her past relationships, she kind of has an unhealthy mentality around 'earning' affection, and definitely has some sort of commitment issues (apparently her last ex said that he didn't really love her for the last year of their relationship, but was too afraid of hurting her to break up with her).

__label__1 He suddenly wanted to have a relationship with her, which I saw as a good thing. I said he could come over to visit as often as he wanted, he just needs to tell me before hand so I can be home. We decided to give our relationship another shot and I got pregnant again immediately. We moved into a house together, I had really horrible morning sickness this time and Bob got disgusted with my neediness and moved out again a week later, leaving me in a huge house I can't afford or maintain, again far away from any form of support necessary for a pregnant mother of a young kid. He seems to love his kid very much but has no concept of taking responsibility.

__label__1 They are always calling me for everything, I don't even wanna answer my phone, but if I don't I may get yelled at. It has happened. I have spent many days and nights in tears because of the stress of this job, and even one morning, threw a bit of a fit when our dm made me come in  because there was another evaluation on my day off. I had to cancel all my plans that day to go in. I couldn't stop myself.

__label__0 I go to the VA and I see people who need it more than me. I make a good living and only want to get on with life. Plus I know filing a claim at the VA is humiliating and I don’t want to go though what others I fear have. Thanks for listening. I posted this as there was a guy on the foxnews site dogging people with fake PTSD because his son served in combat and is fine.

I’m not bound to him anymore, but that doesn’t mean that I don’t panic at the end of each day in the split second that I think it’s going to happen again. I’m an adult now, not a child that was groomed and broken like a horse. I’ll never again have to ask “Can we stop now please?” and get a no. I’ll never have to ask if I’m allowed to put on my clothes and leave.

__label__1 She told me she had one more person to interview and that she would get back to me by Monday. I shook her hand and rushed out the store to another place and went to their restroom. I ruined my hair, I popped a little of my collar and unbuttoned some of my dress shirts. I added some water stains and even took advantage of a partially full cup of soda in one of the stalls. I spilled it on the rims of my shirt but not entirely.

__label__0 I have been an avid Redditor for 4 years but unfortunately don't have the 1000+ karma needed to post on r/Borrow. I would pay $1200 ($1000 + $200 interest) in return by August 24 or earlier. Although I will (hopefully) receiving my stipend by the 6th, I know for a fact I will be receiving my scholarships for fall semester/my first paycheck from my job at home on or before the 24th, so this is just an added safety net in case the stipend takes extra time to process. I'm willing to provide any lender with the relevant personal information in a private message, and will keep in contact as much as necessary until the money is paid back (PayPal woud be best, but I'm open to other options as long as they are available in this country). Thanks for reading!

__label__0 So I decided that I am going to talk to my doctor about tapering off lexapro next week when I go in to see her. I won't lie that I'm scared, but I think it is time. The only real thing that I had while starting lexapro was restless leg and increased anxiety, but this lasted about a week. So let's hear it reddit, what is a taper really like. Oh, male and 20 mg daily for a year is my timeline with the meds.

__label__1 I have had mobility issues since I was twenty three following a difficult pregnancy that triggered inflammatory arthritis and fibromyalgia/chronic fatigue syndrome. Over the years I've had a few falls due to being very unsteady on my feet at the best of times, which have added to my mobility issues. My right ankle and calf are permanently injured, I have achilles tendonitis, plantar faciitis and the muscle in my calf has tightened so much due to the shortening of my tendons that my foot points instead of sitting normally. I have osteoarthritis in my right hip, which slips in the socket and causes a lot of pain, and this has all had an ongoing impact on the rest of my body as my back often spasms or locks and I have issues with a frozen shoulder that limits the use of my right arm. On top of all of this, I have kidney, liver and bladder problems.

__label__0 Can’t wait to reach that phase. I stopped by a small seafood restaurant along the way, to sit and charge my phone and consult reddit. One of the men who worked at this place asked me where were I was from. He was a person who worked for this place for eighteen years, with a golden grill on his teeth. I told him that I started in Brunswick and ended up here and that’s all that mattered.

__label__1 I am so scared that he will realize how fucked up and terrible I am and not want to continue things. I don't want him to go and he keeps assuring me he will not, but I am so, so scared that sometimes it is overwhelming. I feel like this is a disgrace on my part, because, logically, I know that he very much likes me and he really wants to stick around. But there's a part of me that genuinely believes I am not good enough and that I will not be enough once he realizes that. I am so fucked.

__label__1 He would play really loud music on the speaker. It got so bad when he threw the living room table at me.. we got kicked out of at least 4 apartments. At this point we were homeless. He wouldn’t get a job, and wanted me to get out and hold a sign and pan handle for money, if I didn’t he would drive the car we lived in really fast and say he was going to kill us. He wrecked that car (small wrecks) at least ten times.

__label__1 The husband's voice sounds like pure rage, the wife's both angry and defensive. A couple of times there were sounds of broken objects. We have never really talked (they don't speak good English), so I'm not sure how to approach them about it. Calling the police feels excessive, but I'm also worried someone might be abused. What is an appropriate thing to do here?

__label__0 l asked if there was someone else and she said "no, even if there was we weren't in a relationship". Fast forward 3 months and I'm finally over her and life is going great, then I got a text from her and we started talking again. During the holidays I returned to my country and I spent all month with her, this time officially dating. We always kept our relationship open, so we jokingly spoke about one night stands and if we had any during those 3 months apart. We both mentioned that we had one - after we stopped talking.

__label__1 Ive never really had a problem with my education until this semester, I feel mislead in my classes i.e (I do great on the homework and then I end up failing the tests). This has lead to me failing or doing not up to my standards in my other classes and its beginning to effect my own self worth. Instead of being confident in myself im resorting to internal hatred and just overall sadness. I am in a relationship with a very loving girlfriend but I feel that if I bring my problems into it, it could go sideways and I dont want that. Because of all of this my sleep schedule has not been exactly ideal, I usually go to bed at midnight and wake up early for class and the quality of my sleep is not what I would call good (tossing and turning and frequently waking up).

Because of all of this my sleep schedule has not been exactly ideal, I usually go to bed at midnight and wake up early for class and the quality of my sleep is not what I would call good (tossing and turning and frequently waking up).
__label__1 My life has spiralled into a area I’m not sure I can survive in much longer. Everyone who was close to me have seemingly all decided to just pretend I don’t exist right as I start my third year of Uni. My anxiety levels are usually pretty high this time of year but this last month has been the worst of my life for my emotional well-being. I’m trying so hard but I’m suffering, and the meds don’t seem to be helping What do I do

__label__0 It happened in the fall of 2003. I was getting off the bus and a boy that lived in my neighborhood was walking to his house. I ran up and tackled him, as we have done many other days before. We would always wrestle, have snowball fights, goof off. Today was different.

__label__0 Sometimes it really sucks whenever I don't have anything else to give to others. But now that it's winter, I started buying gloves, extra socks, toques, and earmuffs at the dollar store. Last week, I gave away 4 sleeping bags that we no longer use. We have tons of them since my family and friends camp a lot... it's just extra. What other ways can I help and give back to the community?

__label__0 She's super neurotic and would be a project** **A place for my Aunt to stay. She's pretty much helpless on her own. She's 53 and has lived with my grandma basically all of her life.

__label__1 Is this common? How did you deal with it? I want to just apologize and make things right but some of the things the other person probably forgot or were just super insignificant. I want to own up to my actions but it's hard. I assume if people find out I was a jerk they'll all hate me and I'll be an outcast and a pariah :/

__label__0 <url> My mother is 60 years old and has been somewhat homeless for over 2 years now in a city about a 3 hour drive away from me. She often meets people on the street that allow her to stay with them for a little while, but it seems that many get tired of her mania/excessive talking and lock her out. Also, important to note: she is an alcoholic, very intelligent (was a biologist), has had mental issues since 2005, and has been in and out of correctional facilities for various things related to drugs/drinking and violating parole. I haven't noticed her in a depressive state for over 3 years now.

__label__1 Who do I talk to at this point, the Command Equal Opportunity Officer (e-7) who basically says she will look into it but doesn't seem concerned. There is a stigma about asking for help in the Navy and it needs to change. Basically, if you take any meds you get treated like a black sheep. If you go to medical and they give you meds, you get removed from your duties and everyone else carries your load while you are forced to stand around them not allowed to do anything. If you do get out of the navy because you spoke out about being depressed, anxious, or having symptoms of PTSD then you would be seperated from the Navy and sent home.

__label__1 I knew that he was scary when he would pray in front of me, yet the entire thing was an angry ATTACK on God (not trying to get into beliefs here, just what happened.) I knew he knew how wrong he was when he told me one day to not tell anyone but that he actually HAD threatened suicide in front of his ex wife with a knife, yet still painted her as the evil doer in the story. I knew he was lying when he made sure to tell me about how crazy one of his exes went at the end accusing him of rape (why would he even bring it up!!) and how after he took another ex home from injury while we were together, that she might try to lie to me and say that something happened, but NOTHING did! It gave me chills when this man would tell me if his ex wasn't his child's mother he would have had her murdered long ago, and that he had friends offer to help!

__label__1 The next couple of days have been mostly normal. A large group of my friends were visiting so I had a good time, but that episode made me slightly anxious every now and then. I have no prior history of anxiety disorder or mental illness. For all I know, this episode could have been anything or nothing, but I do remember feeling a strong sense of anxiety during the tram ride. At the time, I was attributing it to being a little paranoid on pot, so I wasn't concerned - until I started to lose my vision.

__label__0 I really liked this guy, he was super funny and easy to talk to, and he seemed really trustworthy to me. He told me he had been keeping an eye on me since he saw Pedo talking to me a lot and hanging around me a lot. He told me that two other girls around my age had worked with him before me, but not at the same time. Both girls had quit a couple of months into their jobs, even though they were doing well, seemed happy and very much liked their positions. He told me that both girls had complained a few times to him that Pedo had grown very attached to them and made them feel very uncomfortable, but didn’t know what to do because he was their boss.

I decided to head on over to cancer just to see other people’s point of views of things.

__label__1 I’m currently doing EMDR for my severe anxiety issues and depression. We’re going through past instances that have plagued me and are why my mindset is a negative shithole. I had my anxiety in a certain place, where I felt comfortable. The anxiety was there but I managed it well enough. Things were not perfect and there was still a lot of things that needed to change in order for me to progress.

__label__1 I am 25 years old and recently had to stay with my mother and her new husband. My mom has had issues on and off throughout my childhood, but it is only recently that I identified her as a narcissist. We used to be very close (inappropriately so), but last week she disowned me and asked me to move out over a Reddit post she found of mine (not this account). I am moving out on Sunday, and have been enduring the silent treatment for about two weeks. I was raped by an acquaintance less than 6 months ago, and everything is hitting me all at once.

I am moving out on Sunday, and have been enduring the silent treatment for about two weeks. I was raped by an acquaintance less than 6 months ago, and everything is hitting me all at once.

__label__0 He's exactly what I've needed, maintains his side of an equal partnership, etc. My only problem is that, though our sex life is great, I catch myself being overly sexual sometimes, even if he shows no interest that occasional day, then feeling extremely hurt and rejected if he says that he doesn't want to do anything that day. It's not like we never do anything, I just seem to still be attached to this idea. He shows me he loves me in many different ways but this is so hurtful when I'm aware that it's ridiculous to have these expectations. I guess I'm afraid I'll never stop feeling this way and I'll end up hurt him.

__label__0 I just wanted to thank everyone on this sub reddit for answering my crazy questions. Also for answering my questions with obvious answers when I was too crazy to see the answers. I have been homeless for 3 months. Not anymore! I have my own room I'm renting from a very nice family.

__label__1 Certain things will make me feel uncomfortable. as of recently she will jokingly play with my nipples, like suck on them or biting them if we are laying in bed and I’m shirtless. This makes very uncomfortable and I don’t like it at all. I’ll laugh and tell her to stop and that I don’t like the feeling of it. She will keep jokingly doing so and tell me stop being a baby or that she is just joking around.

__label__0 Edit: She has seen a therapist that diagnosed her with PTSD based on a fear of tornadoes (that she has never been directly affected by other than her parent, father, having them go into a basement as one was nearby). I believe this to be a slight misdiagnosis and the focus of the treatment to be incorrect. I'm looking for support from others that have had similar experiences and perhaps know a bit more about the differences between PD, PTSD, and CPTSD. Going to attempt to summarize the background info with bullet points. -Together for 5 years, married for 1.

There were times he didn't listen to me but I never thought it would lead to him forcing himself onto me. I didn't trust I'd know how he'd react if I did or said anything...He wasn't the gentle and respectful person I thought he was. I left after the shower but when I got home, I broke down.

__label__0 If you knew Garret you would never have seen this coming. The family is exhausted at this point. I just want to do anything I can to help them and this is the platform I have. Any little thing helps. I can't think of a more caring family that is totally deserving of any help they can get.

__label__1 Anytime I have a scheduled transaction towards my checking account, my wages are immediately garnished. However, last night was the real wake up call. After work, I came home drunk and let my stress get the best of me. I ended up getting in a fight with my gf about money, finances and utilities. Not wanting to face the pathetic reality that I have "sugar momma" for a girlfriend, I packed everything I own in my vehicle, parked it less than a mile away (incase I may have forgotten anything) and slept in it until the battery died.

__label__1 Kinda interesting how even when I’m not feeling awful, tiredness still makes me ruminate and feel angry. Hm. I wonder if it’s the biological sleepiness or if it’s kinda a pavlovian response because I’m so used to having terrible feelings when I sleep? Probably kinda both. Anyway, how are you all doing?

__label__1 Hi, I am 21 years old, I used to suffer from panic attacks and anxiety last year, but somehow managed to beat it and live like a normal person again. But from time to time, i have this weird feeling that I am gonna pass out or something like that, my face is pale and I feel this uncomfortable pressure in my eye balls, it happens when I'm at university during class or even during normal daily activities. I did some blood tests and everything is fine, so is this anxiety again?

__label__1 Extra: Apparently he was jailed before marrying my mom and he never told us until she found out later into the marriage. There's more into the story but I would like to know if I can file a charge on him for past incidents as well.... and I am upset that he is going to be charged for misdeamenor instead of felony. Since the victim (my mom) has enough evidences, it will be hard for him to drop the charges right? He has been avoiding the police so it took a while for the police to catch him but he paid for the bail and bailed himself out with a help of his friend. I just wished he would recieve a felony but he pleaded not guilty on the first court appearance and apparently there are more court appearances to be made befoe verdict is finalized....

__label__0 First and foremost, I am not a veteran. I found out about PTSD service dogs from my good friend who also suffers from PTSD and is in the process of training her pup to be a service dog. I have found some helpful resources online giving information about service dogs for PTSD, but most of them seem to be geared toward either: therapy dogs or PTSD dogs only for veterans. <url> ➡️ are all trainings this expensive? <url> ➡️ awesome article, but this website is also for veterans

__label__1 I see him in person 1 - 3 times per week, almost always at restaurants. If it matters, we've never been to each others apartment. It is in his lease that he can't have guests over (???). I've invited him to mine but it hasn't worked out. I have some abandonment issues from friends pretending they like me but actually secretly disliking me, so I have anxiety that he doesn't actually like me.

I have some abandonment issues from friends pretending they like me but actually secretly disliking me, so I have anxiety that he doesn't actually like me.

__label__1 When first diagnosed I was put on a daily prozac. 3 years later, I've managed to wean myself off and just use my klonopin only for the worst attacks. That actually seemed to work well and I've been off the prozac for about a year and even got off Facebook 3 months ago because it was becoming a point of unneeded drama, but I'm suddenly getting the depression symptoms again. I've walled myself off from most people and have become less communicative with my husband. I don't like going to our neighbors house because I have a paranoia that 2 of them don't like me.

__label__1 I was cleaning my house with bleach, got a nasty burn in my throat when I woke up the next day. Day later it went away, but the day after that I got the worst body aches, chills, 100.6 fever, and dizziness for 2 days. It all cleared up but I have had this dry cough for 4 days now with no relief, it keeps me up at night, and I go into these coughing fits. What should I Do? I can't see a doctor for 2 more weeks as I am out of town on a job, i think I am a hypocongiract so ii worry a lot lol.

__label__1 I have almost constant health anxiety. It's a mixture of agoraphobia and health anxiety. I'm afraid of having some incurable disease or suddenly stopping breathing... I've been kinda iffy the past few days, just tired from lack of sleep, and I usually feel like shit after my period which triggers my anxiety. Well anyway I went out to meet my mom for some food and the first thing she says to me is "wow are you okay?"

__label__0 I did something once that I had been doing almost constantly in the intervening years: I imagined my ex-fiancee. But this time, it felt real. "Through the lord, all things are possible" Shock, bliss, happiness, peace, closure, and many other emotions multiplied beyond reckoning coursed through me. I promised my life to God, and continue to believe that he did speak to me.

__label__0 I don't have a therapist right now, and I don't really talk much to anyone about this. Right now, I can articulate how it feels, because it's still fresh. But when I'm feeling good, I have trouble discussing my anxiety. It's not something I want to delve into when I'm in a good mood. I'm not really sure where I was going with this or what I'm looking for, but I just wanted to vent since this was fresh on my mind right now.

He gets delusional at times and he yelled at me “I’m going to off myself if you don’t admit that you were going to call the cops on me for calling the manager at McDonald’s an asshole!” I filmed it. So he said, “here’s your daughter try not to off yourself” He really thinks I’m going to kill myself for no reason....

__label__1 Because i feel like nothing i do isn't even worthy of being considered a success. Because the carpet is cover in pee from animals and reminds me of my mothers house. How i used to go to school every morning covered in cat and dog urine. Every little bit of confrontation feels like world war 3 in my head. Every little feels like it gets put on me as blame and i cant deal.

__label__1 I mean what are you suppose to do when your son is 5 and his older brother who is 16 is picking on him. He was too big for them to punish. So I endured it , some days I hate my whole family for never saying anything. They just were okay with me being scared of my brother constantly. Fast forward to me being 18 living with my other brother.

__label__1 I haven't posted here yet, but as everyone here has probably experienced, PTSD is one of the most isolating conditions. Even as an adult surrounded by other adults at school, I feel so isolated. It's really disappointing that other students in my class can't seem to grasp the concept of PTSD in people who aren't veterans. There is a fundamental lack of understanding that has resulted in further alienation. For some reason, dissociations in sufferers who are not former military is unacceptable.

__label__1 Apparently it doesn't work that way. I don't drink or do drugs anymore (which didn't help keep me safe at all btw) so there is nothing to blur it out. I just have to live with all the horror and memories and I hate it. Tl;dr I hate myself and the life I led. I'm ashamed I didn't figure out that things could be different sooner.

__label__0 I just got an email to schedule an interview for a job. I haven’t heard from the lady a few days after thinking it would take her a few days to figure a time for me to come in and email back. Nope she CALLED ME on the home phone instead today. First off I didn’t know because the caller ID said cellular call and usually I don’t answer those calls because their scams. I later looked up the number I have an app that tells if it’s a scam number, what business it is, landline etc.

__label__1 I've never done this before but we always stay at my house, so maybe the odds are just greater here? After she told me about it in the morning I feel like pure shit. She said my eyes were open and I don't know if she believes it was accidental... How can I manage this situation? That's all I really need to know, I don't know what to do.

__label__1 If they weren't done he would get angry at her. After that he would borrow money from her while he was making a lot of money. Instead of paying her back, he would spend both his income and her money on things he wanted. The next thing was that he would say things like "I'll do this for you but you'll owe me a blow job later." While that worried me the next sign really made me concerned.

__label__1 She says she's sorry and that she would never have taken it to a physical place, and completely rejected the first co-workers request to take it further. However she continued to talk to him and also continued to talk and flirt with the second co-worker, when she knew he had romantic feelings. She says she's sorry and has an addiction to being desired. I told her it's not fair to me or the men she's leading on. She agrees and is trying to convince me to stay with her.

__label__1 I don't know if I should call it abuse. Fiancé suffers from PTSD & alcoholism... Punched me and threw shit at me at an international airport and almost got himself kicked off the flight. Last night was the 2nd time but far worse. He beat me with a bag he thought I packed and thought I was going to leave him (it was a bag I forgot to unpack and was in the closet). My head was bleeding profusely and I (thank goodness) ran outside and called for help...

__label__1 It's like Everyone else is allowed to be frustrated but me. So I use a lot of my UPT (unpaid time off; it's the ONLY time off we get, no vacation or anything) for my sister - her wedding (a whole fucking week), her kids' birthdays that she insists I be at, and things like their baptisms. And I know I use a lot of my hours on them, but overlook it because I love them and know they want to see me. But I only have 6 hours left, and each shift is 4 hours. I might have to use 4 of those today because the front of my house is flooded (there's a car stuck there and an officer blocking off people from entering), because I emailed HR and even sent in a picture but this company just doesn't give a fuck and probably won't cancel.

__label__1 He causes emotional pain to me every day but I cannot get myself to leave him. He physically abuses me sometimes but it rarely leaves a mark or bruise. I feel like even if he cheats on me (again) I still won’t want to leave him. The only way I think I will leave him forever is if I end up hating him. And the only way I will hate him is if he caused physical harm that I cannot lie my way out of like I have in the past.

__label__0 I'll try to keep this short and succint so it's easier to read. I had a very brief relationship with this girl. We both conected inmediately and tried to be in a relationship. We both had problems that consumed us: she was bulimic and I had erections issues; we both had parent issues and a nihilistic aproach to life. I wasn't a (mentally) strong boy, I was very immature and naive, I suppose she was kind of the same.

__label__0 Picked music up again and I'm considering the possibility of doing it for the rest of my life rather than science, which is what I've been led by my environment to believe is my "destiny." Even if I am coming to plenty of realizations, I constantly ponder about our relationship, how horribly it ended, and whether I may have done something wrong and how I can fix a bad quality in myself that made things end that way. I just want to forget. Is this horribly written? I think so.

__label__1 I’m coming to find that my family are rapist sympathizers given the “right” circumstance (ie. sports). How would you want the media to change? What would make it easier to watch the news while also covering newsworthy topics? My head is in a fog still so hopefully that all made sense.

__label__0 It’s like hes expecting my tummy is spilling over my jeans like a muffin(it’s not) I’m still a size small instead of an Xsmall like I used to be when 14 but that’s pretty fucking normal I reckon.its like god help me if I’m a medium right? Today I lashed out at him by saying omg dad it’s cuz I’m wearing these pants today ( the pants which are wide, loos high waisted and make ass look bigger), instead of skinny jeans so I obv gained like 10 pounds or tonnes of kilos or whatever overnight. Later on he said “it’s so easy to make you mad you shouldn’t react that way just cus you don’t think you’re fat”  this made me think that he is doing this to get a rise out of me which isn’t cool for 55 yo dad or you know an adult. Or another reason is probably cuz he is getting older and living a sedentary lifestyle, it’s the holiday season and he put on weight he’s not doing anything about it and he’s taking it out on me, he’s a bit chubby but not like overly flabby it’s just most shirts don’t fit anymore. Anyway this part isn’t relevant to my relationship but I’d like to share anyway.

Later on he said “it’s so easy to make you mad you shouldn’t react that way just cus you don’t think you’re fat”  this made me think that he is doing this to get a rise out of me which isn’t cool for 55 yo dad or you know an adult. Or another reason is probably cuz he is getting older and living a sedentary lifestyle, it’s the holiday season and he put on weight he’s not doing anything about it and he’s taking it out on me, he’s a bit chubby but not like overly flabby it’s just most shirts don’t fit anymore. Anyway this part isn’t relevant to my relationship but I’d like to share anyway.

__label__1 This is marriage #2 for both of us. Husband's (52 M) ex (51 F) cheated, my ex (53 M) had emotional affair, leading to ending marriages in the same year. We dated in high school, and reconnected as friends, started dating about a year later, moved in together after a year, got engaged 2 years after that. Before getting engaged I found out he was having an emotional affair with a woman who lived about a 5 hour drive away from us. I found out when he left an IM open on his computer, found steamy texts when I went to shut off a noisy program.

__label__0 Clearly what i need to do is just talk to her about it. I have a couple of examples in mind that will drive the point home. Mainly the first night i was introduced to everyone and a house warming we went to. We're having dinner tomorrow night. Thanks a ton for the feedback everyone.

__label__1 I’m just wondering how many of you have A LOT of triggers? I was abused extremely horribly as a teenager and into adulthood and I have horrible ptsd from it. I literally get triggered by everything and anything. Like someone could sneeze and it would sound similar to him and I’d freak. I freak out horribly about everything and the littlest things.

She just wanted to know she could introduce me as her bf to friends and people, and to be together. No other changes, really, we were already exclusive.

__label__1 - kicked me out of the house and was going to make me leave in the middle of the night multiple times while insulting me and hitting me I'm sorry to even post this here but I need a little support right now. He said this to me two nights ago and came into our guest bedroom where I was sleeping the next day and said sorry Kind of. I tried to talk to him about it and he said he was under a lot of stress and that he doesn't need my love or support and he doesn't want to talk about it. Super sorry for the fucked up formatting but y'all get the idea...

__label__0 You’re swimming smoothly with the current, the temperature isn’t too cold, and the water is calm and clear blue. So why can you only ever see it as being murky? Sometimes, you find yourself swimming higher and higher, until your fingers skim the interface between the water and the air above. You can see the rays of sunlight above piercing through the surface, refracting and scattering as it hits the water. You approach the surface slowly but surely, excited because you feel like you can finally exit into this warm, golden place, and leave the water behind.

__label__0 So I am okay at making short-term acquaintances, but can't seem to make friends beyond professional relationships, polite greetings, small-talk, etc. I'm sure it's because I have no practice at making friends and the history of relationships I have had feel laced with feelings of betrayal - so maybe I'm self-sabotaging a little bit. But gosh, I would like someone to talk to about day to day life, hopes, worries, goals, etc. Also, I have an eleven year old son for whom I would like to model some more healthy platonic relationships. I work in a field that requires little one-on-one contact, rely on walking/public transportation, and have a busy schedule with kids activities, work, community meetings, so those factors make it extra hard.

__label__1 I'm in my third year at uni and starting my diss now (its due in January), and I'm really struggling with feelings of dread and anxiety. I dread waking up knowing I have to do work, and I compare myself to how much my friends are working. When i see them working I am just filled with dread and guilt. &#x200B; I keep getting to the point now where when I try and do work, I freeze.

__label__1 I need to know what to do. A psychopathic family member was promised MY house, for some strange fucking reason, for apparently a very long time now. I have an abusive ex, that won’t leave me alone and his parents say escape and live with them, but he most likely will follow me where I go. He told me he would. Should I get a restraining order before I go?

__label__0 And I know it wouldn't completely or even halfway make up for me being an asshole lately, but I want to have some improvement on her life with her being loyal to me despite me not even being able to be there for her as a boyfriend. She's helped me so much. She paid for uber's to job interviews (I only got one callback from a GameStop, they said I'll know if I can go for second interview next week), she paid for laundry one week, she even bought me a pizza once and I have nothing to give back to her. I am near Denver, Colorado. And I am hoping for this to be sent to my GF because she truly deserves something great.

__label__1 My ex sent me a video of a switchblade, I asked him why he had that and he said “cutting people up” and then he said “it’s an Italian style switch blade”.. I’m Italian... Anyways, he’s put a loaded gun to my head in the past. I’m actually pretty terrified of him now. He also once brought explosives to my brothers house and claimed he “forgot they were there”.. none of my family or our friends growing up believed me when I told them about him. Which is why I can’t talk to anyone.

__label__1 I'm curious, does anyone know of any programs that provide temporary housing assistance if you have a job? I'm almost broke right now. I really don't want to live out of my car or the shelter while working. Having a comfortable supportive place until I can get my first couple of paychecks would be amazing. I'm worried that my current living situation will ruin my chances to succeed with this job.

I really don't want to live out of my car or the shelter while working. Having a comfortable supportive place until I can get my first couple of paychecks would be amazing. I'm worried that my current living situation will ruin my chances to succeed with this job.

__label__1 I feel sad for you, I feel sad for me. I pray that you will get the help you so desperately need so that nobody else has to endure the terror and horrible horrible physical, sexual, and emotional abuse you have put me through. I am riding myself of all my shame associated with what has happened. I know now, it was all you. I did not do anything wrong to deserve the horrible treatment I received from you.

__label__1 He broke contact with the whole family, only sparingly speaking to his little sister after she followed his example and split. I think he is very ashamed of his past. He *never* talked about anything like this with me. I’m honestly really worried he thinks I would think less of him if I knew, and the idea of that breaks my heart. I didn’t tell him what his sister told me.

__label__0 I have always told her that if there’s anything she wants to know, no matter how uncomfortable it may be, that I’d tell her I the truth and in return that she would do the same. I repeatedly gave warning that I didn’t think it would help and that it was a bad idea. She said she had to know and I told her that I would but she couldn’t turn it into an issue because this all happened before I even knew her. She agreed. I understand people saying that I should’ve given her space when she asked for it, but I am sorry, that is bullshit.

__label__1 Hi everyone,  Sorry to ask but today is my Mum’s birthday. This is the first month in ~6 where I haven’t been paid early, so until tomorrow I have no money. The issue is it’s my mum’s birth today, and she always wants a cake, but I am unable to give her one this year. A nice cake from my local supermarket is £10, and I will be paid by work tomorrow so I can repay you soon.

__label__0 This week, we stayed in the same house and I slept with her. We were watching a movie when she went to go to sleep in the next room (she's very tired a lot). About an hour later, I heard her crying uncontrollably and shaking and screaming. It was really hard to see. I held her until she went back to sleep, and then stayed with her.

__label__1 We couldn’t have Thanksgiving because of money struggles in the family. I am here begging and pleading for help to get some food in our cupboards to help hold us over as long as we can. I’m counting down the days until tax season so we can fill up the pantry! We receive about $700 each year from the Wisconsin Homestead Tax Credit which is what we use to catch up on bills, prescriptions, and to stock up on food. It’s extremely heart wrenching when my own mother or grandchildren cannot have a bowl of cereal because there’s no milk and guess what, no cereal.

__label__1 Being in there was hell, I cried most of the first few days. I was very disoriented, couldn't sleep, the windows had metal grates over them. The bathrooms were locked and you had to ask for permission to use the toilets. While I was waiting to use the toilet the nurse came in my room and grabbed the door out of my hands forcefully and I didn't let go (I think its my right to use the bathroom when I need to). She then came back with a bunch of men and they held me down to the bed, pulled down my pants and gave me a shot in the butt of some sedative.

In the 18 years since I came off the streets I've turned my life around, owned and ran 2 businesses and spent my free time helping other homeless people either get off the streets or access services they are entitled to.

__label__1 I have a very hard time with trying to find a job, from most places I don't get any feedbacks, but get immediate rejection when I try to apply to other open positions at the same company. Interestingly there's a lot of propaganda around how there's a shortage on manpower, while at the same time people having difficulty finding jobs. There are notable instances of similar experiences, political opponents' family members getting fired for no reason, etc. My father did a big disservice to the local Fidesz by being a key figure against the prison project (which was going to be built by a company very well known for overpriced projects), my grandfather is a well known tankie (who's so racist he's often accidentally agrees with both Fidesz and Jobbik), not to mention I had a lot of bullies in secondary school who thought I was severely mentally disabled (long story short: I had some speech issues I've since overcome for the most part, but thanks to the Hungarian R-word I got some serious shit, such as being accused with my mother taking up huge benefit money which she spends on shoes and jewelry, which leads them having to pay a lot of taxes on their motorcycles, game consoles, phones, etc) and probably wanted to take their revenge this way (which is ironic, because the hard time I had financially radicalized me from an actual centrist to a radical leftist). My father is seriously thinking on kicking me out to the streets if I won't pay, which makes me to go back to my mother, and my abusive stepfather who cannot accept my autistic quirks, implying if I can go back to them and my stepfather will let it all go through.

__label__1 Grad school isn’t really the easiest place to parent alone. Assistantships don’t pay you enough to live off of by yourself (Mine nets me a little less than $800 a month, rent is $750), let alone with a tiny human that needs a particular type of education. They also require you commit to 20 hours a week of on campus work. Essentially meaning, you can’t really hold a full time job anywhere. On top of this, working another part time becomes difficult because work hours have to coincide with the hours your little one is at school, and with 20 hours a week on campus already, that leaves little time to actually work anywhere else during school hours.

__label__0 We broke up a month ago because the distance made us miserable. We had only been doing long distance for 3-ish months, which is not long at all, but we had been dating before that for roughly 3 years, with a short break in between. I'm taking a gap year so I've been bouncing from place to place & my parents are so protective that they don't let me visit friends at college often (especially not her since they are suspicious of our relationship anyway [homophobia lol]). I did visit her once, but only for a few days and she visited me in return. Anyway, we both couldn't commit to a strict schedule of meeting up because of school, parents, money...

__label__1 When I take the time to relax and think of something nice like a waterfall or a forest or something like that I then automatically think of how bad people are going to mess it up and pollute and make it worse and just be awful. It makes it hard for me to relax. I try to think of something tranquil and then thoughts like these pop into my head. Meditation isn't that nice for me. My mind just races.

__label__1 It feels as if no one understands what I’m going through in my life because I took a while to leave and didn’t tell anyone until now. I really didn’t think it was that bad. Now that I’m out of the situation, it still haunts me. I feel guilty and still like it’s all my fault somehow even though it’s irrational and not true. Does anyone else feel like this?

__label__0 So I have a buddy who still lives with his step dad, mom, and brother. Long story short, I just found out through him that his step dad hits him and occasionally his mother. It came out when he was drunk along with other behaviors. When my friend gets drunk he likes to aggravate people until they try to beat him up and until recently I just thought he liked fighting. But he told me it is because his step dad hits him so getting in fights gives him a weird sense of worth.

__label__1 &#x200B; I'm in our room watching some relaxing Youtube videos trying to cheer myself up. My boyfriend wants me to come out and do weekend stuff but the energy is so high out there I think it'll set off an attack. He wants to bad to help but he doesn't know how and I don't know how either. &#x200B;

__label__0 I went on a holiday with my best friend [26M] and husband [26M]. My husband and I have been together for ten years (married for six). My best friend and I have known each other for three years, and spend a huge amount of time chatting with each other on the internet. I love him to death, and he makes me insanely happy. My friend lives decently far away, so we don't see each other often.

__label__0 So lets forget all about my biological father. My father once told me : "Money do not fall from tree's", but, boy oh boy, was I ever going to show him wrong. It all started with the fact that one day I got out of bed, and had the weird idea that I was going to die at 21 yrs old. I was listening to The Doors at that point, and Black Sabbath and everything in between those two. And while listening to The Doors, it opened the the doors of perception to me.

__label__0 Could we all at least help out by chipping in at least a dollar for this van? Could we please give this family a break by helping and donating for this van!? These boys and her need it so much!! It would be worth every penny to be able to go on more play dates with her two boys and make their little live’s more adventurous. It would open up a door to giving them easier and more convenience access to fun spontaneous trips to go play and have fun.

__label__1 I think this is a good conversation to have in person, but I likely won't see him for months. Would it be tacky/wildly unromantic to do this over text/email? Additionally, I don't want to ruin things between us or make things weird, and I'm not sure how to broach the subject. How do I not screw this up?   ---

__label__0 Meet with her today and express this is a concern for me. She says she doesn't see what the big deal is, people make mistakes and forget things. I agree and tell her they often forget what they don't care about. She doesn't agree, we talk about it. She feels I am being very black and white in my thinking.

__label__1 So I knocked and told her to please let me in. She refused, I told her I was sorry and I didn’t mean any of the things I said and that I love her very much. She said to go away so I did (we were at her house). Now a whole day passed and she still refuses to talk to me :( I’m worried, guilty and just want to hug her and tell her again that I’m sorry. I sent her some messages but she ignored them.

__label__1 He has even made a comment to my bf about me being overweight. Being overweight has basically taken over my relationship, my mind, and my life. This year, I am making it a priority to lose the weight, especially since I have nothing else occupying my mind like cancer. My confidence level right now is 0 and I feel so fucking ugly and fat. If I just got in shape, I know that I would be close to a 10.

__label__0 I generally like to finish the stuff I do that I consider to be work related but some things like video games, series or anything like that I don’t want to end. I am scared of finishing them since I know going back to it won’t be the same. After I finish them everything about it just feels so empty, like it has no value anymore. Knowing I can never experience it the same way again makes me not want it to end. I go from loving it and then afterwards never wanting anything to do with it anymore.

__label__1 I’m noticing a pattern where my body is like rejecting my partner and I’m concerned it might be caused by my abuse at an early age. Should I seek counseling? But I’m afraid if I do I’m going to have to talk more about what happened and I’m going to break. I’ve talked to therapist before but whenever the topic of the abuse arises I tense up and can’t remember anything. I’m sorry if I’m rambling on it’s just a hard subject for me to talk about and I don’t know how to put into words the emotions I feel towards these events.

__label__1 For example, she once tried to stab her mum's boyfriend because she didn't want her mum to be with anyone - they were in their mid 60s. She has been in a lot of fights over the years, but in general isn't usually physically violent - it's usually manipulation. I'm concerned because she found out last night that he is seeing this ex gf of his. He doesn't know how she found out - he's kept it very, very private. She came back to the house they used to share (he was there with their kids in bed while she had been out) and lost it with him.

__label__1 This is the first time that i'm opening up about this, so please be kind. I'm from India - stereotypically known as the land of doctors and engineers. And while that's just a stereotype, my studies give me anxiety. I had my first attack two years ago - and I have been talking to people since then - but my recent graduation exams have left me worse then ever. What i want to know is, when was your first attack and how are you doing now?

__label__0 The place where I was going for therapy decided that they couldn't appropriately treat me. I've had a tough time finding another therapist. The strange thing is I've been feeling better out of therapy then when I was in it. I was doing a type of exposure therapy and it was rough. I went twice a week and it felt like my whole life revolved around trauma.

Actually I'm not sure if that's what it really is. I recently got a prescription for trazodone (about six weeks ago), and it has helped with having fewer nightmares.

__label__1 The thought of helping people, curing diseases and caring for someone makes me happy. Imagine a person who’s an asshole but need help on health, I would help him/her. However, I need to finance med but I need to work on my current stature to get the money but this job makes me anxious to the point that I am having refluxes because of stress just the thought of working on it. The problem with me is I know I can do for the meantime this job but it was a mistaken path, I could have done dev since it involves little customer interaction. I felt helpless because I need the money but feels like I am fooling myself to work my ass up for something that is not my passion.

__label__0 My ex thought that show was terrific inspiration. He used it to discuss “what if”s with his guy friends, who I hope had no idea how real he is about that shit. I called it “The Rape Along/Beat Along Show” for the longest time. I still do when Gramma isn’t listening. Last time I unexpectedly came across the DVD set (Grampy accidentally left it at my place on the kitchen table, and, yes, he’d been told not to leave it where I might see it)...

__label__0 Hello, You are invited to complete a survey for a WMU psychology department research project designed to assess treatment preferences among adults seeking treatment for a variety of concerns. We hope to learn if and how preferences for treatment change over time, and if patient’s perception of their treatment’s match to their preferences is related to the benefit received from treatment. The survey is open to anyone ages 18 or older who is currently engaged in mental health treatment for at least one month and four therapy sessions, and not longer than one year. If you choose to participate, you will be asked to provide some demographic/background information, respond to survey items about your preferences for treatment and how they have changed over time, and about your quality of life. The survey may take between 30-40 minutes to complete.

__label__1 Hi, I'm 14F and because of health issues I missed a lot of school and eventually started homeschooling this year I didn't have any friends at public schools and I just sit in the house all day now. I can't join a sports team because of formerly mentioned health issues and I live in a town where a car is a necessity so it's not like I can walk anywhere but I'd like to make friends or just get out of my house for the first time in months and socialize face to face any ideas as to what I can do. TL;DR: I'm homeschooled lonely and can't join a sports team how do I make friends.

__label__1 So I have ptsd from an abusive relationship I ended about 3 years ago. When I felt healthy enough I went to therapy and did emdr and it helped and I thought i was doing well. I even moved to a different state so I could quit triggering my flashbacks a year and a half ago and haven't had a single flashback until last night. I have started dating a guy I'm pretty smitten about and last night we went out with friends and had a really good time but we also had been drinking. Something triggered me and i had a flashback and was not able to control my emotions because I had been drinking it was like I went from laughing having a good time to having a panic attack and asked him if we could leave and we did.

__label__0 After the 6 months we moved to a really big house the next town over. It was 3 times the size of the one that burned down. My mom got fired though from nursing because she was caught stealing drugs. My dad graduated college and had a good job in IT and a newspaper place. I don't understand how they could afford such a big house.

__label__0 The gist of the comments received was the K isn't going to change and I should get B to go to counselling to help her with her self-esteem and give her some outside input. Of course, now K is having an online "role playing relationship" with some lady on Grand Theft Auto RP. B is helping him court her. She is presenting it as she is okay with this. Listen, I've known B since high school, I've known her longer then my brother.

__label__1 throwaway... sorry if this all sounds very messy. I have a history of child sexual abuse, rape in a past relationship and problems with dissociation. So I was feeling like a robot that day again, due to stress. I then went to my boyfriend. I told him I am dealing with that again, he knows about my problems.

__label__0 In prison, I was housed with two other person, we already had planned to take over the leadership of the gang that had control of our wing. We were making weapon, I got into a fight with one of the guy. I knew I was getting out soon, but I couldn't tell people, so I acted as if I was there  until my court date. I was the guy who kept watch for the guard while my cellmate created a weapon out of his bed sheet ( strangulation ). I had won protection from them by giving them drugs.

Is it anyone’s fault at all? Could the tree ever be quite corrected, or was it destined to live out its life, becoming more and more crooked with each fucking day? I’m done.

They had previously decided that there wasn't much they could do unless she came up to him. Then tonight happened, the head of HR is severely worried for her safety (and my SOs) in a way he wasn't before. The head has called the Domestic Violence Hotline himself, and is looking for resources to help him solve this very delicate/tricky issue.

__label__1 Should I just go ahead and get help? Am I worried about nothing? Is there a way to lose the worst bits of anxiety while keeping the bits that are perhaps somewhat helpful? Or have I got this all wrong and it's not anxiety (but perhaps something else) that makes me productive, etc? Or should I just accept all the awesome things in my life as a totally worthwhile price for feeling worried?

__label__1 I had suicidal thoughts while working at the island. I had to cut it short and come back home. I was too sad to continue. Eddy and I reunited, and I assumed we were back together since it seemed so. When he got drunk he would literally switch back and forth to being happy and giggly to wanting to die and hating himself.

__label__1 Can anyone relate to this feeling? I can’t enjoy myself at things like concerts anymore. I’m not fully present because I have to try so hard to curb feelings of anxiety and hyper-vigilance. When anyone gets too close to me or accidentally touches me I freak out. Tonight I went to a concert and I was so self-conscious and distracted by the fear that I was going to be assaulted that it was difficult to focus on the actual show.

__label__0 Haven't felt this excited about someone since my ex from over five months ago. This guy, J, and I met on Bumble. I haven't even met him yet, but we have spent hours chatting on the phone and laughing. It all feels really effortless. I've dated a lot since the break up and no one has clicked with me like he has.

__label__1 A few years ago I witnessed an accident at this time of year and I am beginning to remember it again. At night I hear the sound and burst into tears and calm down until I hear it again and start crying. I didn’t know the person involved but I was one of the closest to it when it happened but I’m beginning to sort of enjoy the release from crying and fantasize about telling people about it. I feel guilty for this indulgence and feel like maybe I am just looking for attention. I have always had bad anxiety and mild depression so is it just that?

__label__1 i realized i was already 20k in student loan debt and i was not going to waste all that debt on a school that is considered "lame". some of the best friends i have ever had were at the school, but i traded them for a lifestyle of drugs, sex and redundancy. This new school was considered a party school, one of the best in the country. Due to my good academic standing at my last university i was able to transfer here. but upon first getting their i had already become homesick and depressed.

__label__0 Over the last 18 months we have become closer than ever and as best friends living separately have grown our life together. 8 years ago we were panhandling for gas money to get to work, and now we are for successful business owners. We have spoiled my daughter rotten. Designer clothes, designer makeup, way too much freedom, gym membership, and anything else a 14 year old girl could ever want. I think a lot of that comes from the fact that we were not able to provide her with anything for so long.

Than randomly, out of nowhere, no response... Few days , weeks, and now about 2 months. I called texted for about the first 2 weeks to see what was going on. Than just stopped trying.

__label__0 Especially the power of healing brought upon by service animals. I too, have a service dog named Luna. This wonderful man was nice enough to bring the book back in while I was off yesterday with a note with his name and number telling me to call him when I finish the book. This just made my day, it really did. There’s so much negativity in the world today and it seems not many people will stop to do something nice for someone, or help them by doing a random act of kindness.

__label__1 My bond about was about 100 less than my whole savings. First place I went after getting out of jail was my work, my boss told me if I had got out 2 days earlier I would still have my job. I'm about to do something stupid out of frustration and anger. I was so close to getting off the streets. Fuckkk

__label__1 This is an idea that my father also reinforced in me heavily. I remember vividly when I told him that everything was my fault (in my child mind obviously meaning "you make everything my fault" which was very much the state of things in the house growing up) and he straight up told me to stop fucking up so much if I didn't want things to be my fault (I should emphasize all "fuck ups" were minor- letting a pack of strawberries go to waste, forgetting to call him as soon as I left school, etc- but punished severely). Hell, even if I'm in the *wrong* now I feel like I'm still a victim. I can't gauge conflict to save the life of me- even if I'm being an absolute ass, I'll feel like I'm the one who's being persecuted. My last relationship was a while ago, and lasted about a year.

__label__1 I love her too, but I am super paranoid about the whole deal. Current situation: We both confessed that we love each other, but I won’t be going back to my home country for another 6 months. Because of my past toxic relationship I fear things will change between us, we’ll get into fights/have trust issues etc. Problem: Should I get into a LDR with her, or we should continue being best friends( which would be hard because she has already very clearly confessed she loves me) problems are: 1.

__label__0 Sorry, this will probably be a little long. So, I broke up with my boyfriend of over a year early last month, and it's been... rough. Half the time, I don't even know why we broke up. When people ask me about it, I get so confused as to what to say, because I feel like even *I* don't know. I thought our breakup was mutual.

__label__0 It didn't go exactly how it should have done though, and the female had to go to theatre and lost 3 pints of blood. My aim is to get my story published, and once it is selling, the money I need to initially get the book into print would be donated to research into TTTS. Over and above the £2500 donation, a percentage of all further sales would be donated to this important research. If you can please take the time to click the link below, and share what I am trying to do, I would be very appreciative. <url>

__label__1 I’m 20, and I feel like I missing out on the “real adult life”. I live with my parents I can’t decide what to eat, I can’t have my alone time without being anxious.

__label__0 She told me she was excited, I was just more enthusiastic about it. I let it go, and we went out with friends for new years. I still felt this distance.

She didn't seem to care.

__label__0 The list I will probably choose from right now is Santa Monica, Orange, Costa Mesa, Santa Ana, or Long Beach. I've lived in the city for a bit before and I like the more inner-city of LA but I think I need a change so I'm looking for a more coastal area to find a minimum wage job, settle in, and potentially seek housing in eventually. Don't have much interest in SD, nor in going up north to San Fran. Hoping to get some input from you guys and it is very much appreciated.

__label__1 I had bought our son a special outfit themed from the movies just for this occassion. Neither of us got much sleep that night, and when I tried to talk to him in the morning about leaving, he got really agitated and raised his voice to me. Our daughter ran into her room and I found her hiding under her covers. After again trying to talk to him, he ended up refusing to go, I'm still not sure why. He then ignored me for days again, we again briefly made up for my son's birthday, and started fighting again not long after.

__label__1 So I've basically got a plan: hoard all my drugs until Tuesday, OD that night with a combo of slit wrists and maybe even hanging. I want it to be damn efficient, because this is trial number 13. These are the thoughts I've been having lately. My last attempt was at a hospital, just a few days ago, but I lied and told them it was my anxiety that led me to self-harm. They discharged me.

__label__1 I never thought I’d be in a situation like that in my life and the screaming and blood and chaos following it is just on a constant repeat in my head that won’t stop. I had to give 4 separate statements to the police which burned it from start to finish in my brain and it doesn’t stop. I don’t know if that’s just because it was less than 24 hours ago and I’m still just in shock? It’s just a lot to take in right now  and I’m not sure what to do. I apologize for any formatting issues because I’m on mobile/ sounding incoherent I’m just kind of numb after all this and unsure what to do.

__label__0 So here’s he thing. I do have feelings for him. They just aren’t the intensity level I’m used to feeling when I fall for some one. I normally have this sense of urgency. Its this “Crazy about you/can’t live with out you” type feeling.

__label__1 Ugh. I just need to tell people who I know will understand what happened. If you can relate, offer support, anything... that would be appreciated. I've been dealing with this disease for years now, and I just had the worst flashback I've ever had. My boyfriend had a long day and was going to sleep before me.

__label__0 I refuse to hurt them like that. But I won’t give up, either. Literally all I want is to have them back half the time, so I can go to the beach with them, and to be licked to death, and not have enough room in my bed. I don't dream of cars, or millions of dollars, or girls. I dream of seeing them again.

__label__1 I used to take sleeping pills that had a bit of anti anxiety medicine in them but my pcp drug tested me and because I had been found to have been smoking weed , ( for my ptsd ), it was either stop coming their for the sleeping pills or weed. I chose weed mostly because I was pissed they drug tested me for one but also weed seems to do the best for me. Now im regretting that decision. I guess I need a new pcp huh? Anyway its a reddit until I dont feel like a deer in headlights  kind of night so whoopee.

__label__1 Every time I tell him to leave he threatens to harm my pets or take them and release them to the wild (I have ferrets.... they CANNOT survive in the wild where I live) or he goes into rants about how useless I am and how I couldn't survive without him and somehow he worms his way back in for fear he might be right. TLDR; need him out. He threatens animals. **REALLY** don't wanna involve police. What do I do?

__label__1 My mom has always been a pushover and is known to give him money with no questions asked. Last night, my brother sent a group message to me and my sisters telling us to not tell our parents anything he is saying and that he loves us very much. He says he started selling drugs recently to make more money and some of his supply was stolen and now he's afraid his "friend"/dealer will come after him. I offered to let him spend the night at my house if he felt unsafe, but he declined my offer and said that he'll take care of it. I tried to reassure myself that no dealer will kill someone over a missing gram of pot (he was advertising on snapchat) and I went to bed hoping that he would just get roughed up if anything.

__label__1 Kinda. But now it’s just weird. He buys us matching clothes, tries to get us to do the same shit, constantly insists that we’re so similar, etc. They try to hold my hands when we go out, and when I told my dad I needed her to stop being so touchy with me, he guilt tripped the fuck out of me. I’m 19 in a few days, I need to get out of here, but I feel so fucking guilty.

__label__0 I have a cat and a dog. Without going too much into my personal circumstances, I am being forced to leave my residence very soon. I have no family or friends able to take me or my animals in. I think I may be able to leave my dog where he is currently for a few months. My cat is a 9 year old spayed female.

__label__0 First time posting here so I apologize if I am breaking any rules. I have been taking Sertraline (Zoloft) for about 10 years now. At my lowest points, I was taking 200 mg a day but I have been stable on 150 mg a day for a while now. I would like to one day be off of it completely, but I know that will take a lot of time and work. My question is, can anyone tell me their experiences with withdrawal symptoms?

__label__1 It makes me so disappointed in myself because I hate what I've become and I hate feeling so helpless. I'm to the point where I'm afraid, not knowing why. Most days I end up crying at work. I have no friendship or relationship with those I work with and cannot feel comfortable around them. There's even an awkwardness with my manager who only talks to me to criticise and complain, and just before my holiday she gave me an informal warning.

__label__0 Can you contribute your story alongside others who have been/ are going through recovery? I am developing a storytelling and mental health platform with the ultimate aim of curating a museum exhibition. Soul relics Museum is a platform for people to read and tell stories of mental health through objects that help them connect or express to a present or past experience they have had with their mental health. It’s a unique and creative idea to help people come forward and share with others what mental health problems have been like for them and a safe and constructive way to read of others experiences while being brave enough to share your own. Together, we can create a collective voice in raising awareness and education on mental health!

__label__1 I know that I can't be unemployed forever but I'm just too anxious to really do anything. And everyone in my family keeps asking what my plan is and I keep lying because saying I've got nothing is just too humiliating. I'm just stuck. Have any of you gone through something similar, and have any advice? I appreciate it.

__label__1 In some ways, I can handle it more than the average person who hasn't gone though such a trauma. Sometimes it's hard to remember that, though, when you're breaking down over some otherwise harmless feedback. I'm tired of people misunderstanding. I'm tired of feeling weak and broken. I'm just tired.

Something specific *must* have happened to get them all to turn it off at once. For the life of me, I can't think of what it might have been. And that's what bothers me.

__label__0 And everyone was passive aggressive. The manager tried to peg down my salary multiple times like a fucking haggler at a market. Anyway, I decided to go get some antidepressants and the bottle fell out of my pocket, a coworker noticed and reported it to my boss. Who smiled and asked if there was anything I'd like to tell her. The passive aggressive shit really got to me, and then I realized that I was being illegally paid.

__label__1 The following week, my mom let me use her car to drive my brother to another city for an appointment. The car is going to be mine when she buys herself a new one, so I was really excited about driving it around more often. Everything was fine until I got to the actual city and then a woman drove through a red light and hit my mom's car. I held myself together because my younger brother was with me and he has his own depression to deal with, he didn't need to see his sister break down. The car was still driveable, so I dropped him off and his appointment and then had my meltdown in the drivers seat while explaining everything to my mom.

The car was still driveable, so I dropped him off and his appointment and then had my meltdown in the drivers seat while explaining everything to my mom.
__label__1 The following week, my mom let me use her car to drive my brother to another city for an appointment. The car is going to be mine when she buys herself a new one, so I was really excited about driving it around more often.

__label__0 I refuse to carry both of us anymore and I'm also tired of the drama between us as well. So, part of me hopes he doesn't pay the rent and that'll give me my push to really move on. Anyway, I'm ok with going to a shelter, but I worry about my laptop. I remember when I was living in a shelter when I was a kid, they didn't allow you to have certain items. I don't want to part with my laptop for them to keep it safe and it gets "lost".

__label__1 Kyle got out and started contacting me again, writing letters to “prove he still knew where I lived”, and “being able to get in touch with me regardless of me blocking him”. I have some friends in the police force near me, who I informed of the situation. About the same time I started talking to them, Kyle was put in jail for separate reasons. Since these two events, he has stopped contacting me (thank Christ.) James knows about Kyle, but I haven’t told James about the most recent developments because he has had a lot going on (a death in the family, health issues, among others).

__label__0 I feel like I let my colleagues down and I was scared that I would be reprimanded, thankfully the owners were understanding. I have never had an optimistic outlook on travelling. I've never travelled further than a province or two and it makes me so nervous and anxious just thinking about it. My first instinct is to say thank you for the offer, but my answer is no. One of the owners came to talk to me and explained how great of a worker I am and how appreciated I am around the office.

__label__0 (felt kinda awkward, but they know i dont want her any harm, but have to protect myself now) I still feel like crap for ending it right before her surgery. When she got angry she also insults me for that, that she can never forgive me that ive done this at this time. 2 minutes later she apoligizes for saying that. Shes really struggeling.

__label__1 I have trouble connecting to it on a personal level, but isn't that healthy separation of past/present? I think my present anxieties/self image issues stem from traumatic experiences, but I can talk about these things fairly openly in a way that feels rehearsed. I had a panic attack where I felt terrified and unable to move at my psych's this past Tuesday, but that's not typical for me, at least not anymore? I realized most my recent "panic attacks" may be "breakdowns" because it's not accompanied by a sense of fear, but pent up emotions I haven't been able to release resulting in a sudden loss of control... I start hyperventilating, screaming, and unleash all this pent up fury to the point where I feel detached from my emotions/self and have no control, start throwing things or hurting myself, until I'm exhausted and suddenly shut down/dissociate.

__label__1 I wanted to go to this art school in an expensive city only because this place is wayyyyyyy cheaper then most art schools and it has all the majors I'm interested in, which I could use for like storyboards for movies and what not. They have really nice dorms and if I could just get the funding for school I could do that, but I have really bad mental illness and I need my cat, he checks to make sure I'm breathing at night and comforts me during panic attacks. Which means I'd need an apartment, and a job. I'm not against working my ass off, I'm just getting down right now, no responses to applications can do that. I'm in a state that doesn't even have a real art school.

__label__1 For the last week, my car has been acting up. Yes, it's 16 years old but the only other person to have the car before I did was my 85 year old grandmother who only drove it to either the grocery store or the thrift store, so I got it almost brand new. But lately everything g has been going wrong. The gas gage doesn't work, the dash lights don't work, my tires need to be filled at least once every day, the brakes go out often, my battery won't start if it gets too cold, and now the transmission is starting to have issues. Without a job, I don't have money to pay to fix everything.

__label__1 It was no longer just about the life and love we were building together. It was no longer about us, it was about me and trying to fill this hole within myself. If she would just want me, make me feel wanted, I could baptize myself in it and finally let go of all this guilt and self-hatred. This male shame. It’s complicated.

__label__0 I sometimes call it "fight mode". Extensive martial arts background has turned negative adrenalized states from inward, depressive vulnerability to external, physical reactivity. I describe it as feeling like I'm in a fight (physiologically) though I am sitting still or trying to sleep. Loss of fine motor skills, hypervigilance, scanning all surroundings and people as if they are about to hit me and I have to hit back. I could be stretching, but I feel like this "fight" response as opposed to my old "flight" or "freeze" response has effected even the emotional aspects of my attacks.

__label__0 She wrapped her arms around me and cried for dear life I growled at him to stop at once for he had scared her..he tried to take her from me as he continued to yell and she would not let him touch her That was the final straw. And he saw it in my eyes. He turned into the fake man I fell in love with again, but I was done

__label__1 Is this what a guy who loves you deserves? Is this my punishment for life? Doesn’t some part of you feel something for me? I see you and Jane are out tonight so as I sit here alone and dying inside knowing that the most important thing in my life is leaving me and I’ll never even see you again, doesn’t something inside you feel just a morsel of empathy and reciprocal love back for me and to me and want to give me some chance? Why do I have to be destroyed for this?

__label__0 And I found as I got older, I always turned to women for support. My first marriage didn't work out, but I tried. And my second has been beautiful, we've been together for nearly 18 years, married for 16. We still have a lot of fun and while she doesn't understand what we went through first hand, she's perfectly supported me and we've built a good life together. My mum never had another relationship.

__label__1 For me, that doesn't HELP AT ALL. It just makes me feel like I'm just pissing him off, and my problem has suddenly become his, minimizing my emotions about it? (I hope that makes sense). He always says I need to be protected, but he doesn't understand that it's not an imminent threat in my life anymore, but a constant struggle and disability; that my brain works and processes things differently now and always will. I just feel so very alone when I talk to him.

I just feel so very alone when I talk to him.

__label__1 I've been skipping my classes and haven't gone out with any of my friends because I'm afraid I'm going to get sick when I go out. I'm supposed to go visit my boyfriend at his school tomorrow (I'm on spring break and he's not) and I'm already worrying about if I'm going to get sick and if I even want to go incase I start to feel nauseous and get a bad stomach ache while I'm there.... I'm wondering if anyone else deals with a lot of nausea from their anxiety and what they do to cope with it? I'm terrified of throwing up and so this is like the worst symptom I could ever have.... plus I always have this weird feeling in my chest/throat like something is coming up or is stuck and am belching a lot, like tiny burps. I feel like I'm crumbling and am starting to really slow down... My anxiety/depression has never gotten this bad before and I've just been a sad shell in my bed, can't even find the energy to turn on my TV and pay attention to anything.

I'm terrified of throwing up and so this is like the worst symptom I could ever have.... plus I always have this weird feeling in my chest/throat like something is coming up or is stuck and am belching a lot, like tiny burps. I feel like I'm crumbling and am starting to really slow down... My anxiety/depression has never gotten this bad before and I've just been a sad shell in my bed, can't even find the energy to turn on my TV and pay attention to anything.

Cats transfer FIV though deep bites from other cats with it, which means at least one of his siblings also has it. Ernie being FIV means that his body is not capable of fighting off diseases. He cannot go outside because if he gets sick his body will not be able to heal, so we keep him inside.
__label__1 i never really knew people gave a shit about me, and it really meant a lot to me; it still does. but if so many people are here for me, and things are going to be okay, why am i still afraid of them? why do i still have a pit in my stomach and why are these thoughts still clawing at the sides of my skull? why am i crying right now? i don't understand it, i don't understand my own brain and i feel like an ungrateful prick for still being shaken up so badly.

__label__1 Has anyone else who's dealt with anxiety their entire lives become very controlling in their relationships as a way to cope? Speaking to my therapist I'm realizing that my method of coping with the intense anxiety I've faced in life was to become so organized that I thought I could control everything. But when situations arise, especially with those I'm in a relationship with where I can't control the situation, my anxiety goes out of control so I end up lashing out in negative ways. If you have found you were controlling and were able to better yourself can you please direct me on where to turn to do the same?

I offered her time alone and she was so unsure in herself that she didn't even know if she wanted to take me up on the offer. I said that I think we should wait until your appointment in March to freeze your ectropion, to see if that improves your libido. We ended up crying and cuddling each other.

Multiple things keep the DDLG from relationship from being public and I hate sneaking around. I want to have an open relationship with the other girl.

__label__0 When we were leaving that place the manager was attempting to rush us to get our apartment serviced with 24 hour notices of intimidation and behaving in an angry way leaving mean voicemails and papers at our pissed on door. She yelled at my +1 that I lived with. Toward the last few months we were documenting everything and collecting paper copies of all communication that we had with her. She was another narcissistic manager and the tenant was an animal abuser. I wish there was an actual law that the ASPCA would be in partner with that coulda’ helped me and my +1 while living at the second apartment.

__label__1 I haven’t really complained. Only once when my gram asked me to do a million and one things in a span of a few minutes (go get this go do that) when i was already trying to setup my moms new iPad so she could watch Netflix in the hospital. That all said and done and I feel like shit. Idk if it’s sick but it also feels a hellavua Lot like anxiety. So i get my mom who’s in the apartment next door to ask her to lay with me for a few minutes.

__label__0 I am lazy, this I can attest to. She brings up the Christmas tree, and how we haven't taken it down yet. I just stand in silence from her barrage, then take a bite of my sandwich. I start to take off ornaments and lay them aside.   She starts to rummage around and escalate and point out things that we haven't done, getting progressively louder.

__label__1 I'm a freshman in college. I had to move out asap due to a volatile home situation, and I'm still struggling with finances and figuring out the real world. I just got a job, but am currently extremely sick, and worried about starting. Even so, my phone bill is due and I won't be paid for a few weeks. Student loans don't come in until January.

__label__1 I posted about a month ago and felt pretty defeated (but very grateful to receive anything at all because one very generous gentleman gave me $100) but I am back to the end of the month with a phone bill due tomorrow and dwindling food and gas and rent approaching soon. I’m 25f and 4 months in recovery. I’m working part time to focus on recovery but trying to find a second job so I can stop finding myself in money binds. I have no friends and family to ask for money and have made literally $550 since July working for Bath and Body Works and $200 with DoorDash since August. My rent is $600 and phone bill is $55 and car insurance is $100 which I haven’t even paid this month.

__label__1 My problem is, if I'm going to date anyone, they have to be aware that I struggle with PTSD and willing to at least be there for me when I need. I don't need coddling or protecting, I just need someone to hold my hand and let me cry it out, or help me through a flashback. I need someone who can *be* present and emotional, and someone I can feel comfortable having a conversation with about it. Everytime I have had a breakdown, and try to express things from the past, he audibly growls and talks about how pissed he is that it happened. He talks about what he'd do to my abusers if he ever found them.

__label__1 I assumed she would answer the question, or she would explore my feelings of inadequacy, or she would interpret the transference. But her response instead was the title "I am not getting into this with you". She then went on with how she did like me, thought I was an interesting and nice person. but I do not believe that, it is too unlikely. Besides, as an addendum to her refusal to speak to my question, it seemed false.

__label__0 Saturday, September 29 is the Bay Area premiere of WRESTLING GHOSTS, an excellent new documentary that follows Kim, a young mother, as she does the work to heal from her difficult childhood. I saw the film this week at the L.A. Film Festival. It's the first film I know of to show what healing actually looks like, the long, slow, difficult, rewarding journey. You see Kim checking off her ACE score, meeting Donna Jackson Nakazawa, and most importantly in therapy, using EFT (tapping) and neurofeedback. You see her change and grow.

__label__1 I got a very bad feeling but I at first ignored it. The babysitter was a man and someone I had never met! I was scared because I didn't know this man and I didn't understand why her Mother thought it was alright for a man to babysit 2 girls, one of them being a child he never had contact with. Her Mom proceeds to leave the house and we're there with this strange and creepy man. I was completely uncomfortable the entire time.

__label__1 I wound up in partial hospitalization and diagnosed with PTSD related to several traumas including sexual assault I experienced as a child. I asked for a meeting with all of upper management so that I can start back up at work with clear boundaries for what I won't accept anymore. This will be a good thing in the end, but right now I feel like I'm going to throw up. Meeting is in 3 hours. Send good vibes please?

__label__0 I was in a relationship, so I didn't really let it go anywhere, but hell, it was a new experience for me, and I liked being liked. Fast forward half a year to my breakup. She had moved to a different job, but we bumped into each other in Wal-Mart, if all places. We hit it off, and it wasn't long before a date turned into two, then more. I moved in with her, but maintained a separate apartment for a few months at her request (her family was very judgemental about 'living in sin').

It's been less than a week and not even sure what I'm dealing with here but all I know is that I feel like I am being discouraged from getting help. Most of my recommendations have been people that are "off-record". I've talked a little with them and have talked amongst my friends and they say they do not feel they are any help.

__label__1 It’s becoming cyclical for me, where I “retreat” and revise and then feel like I need to retrigger myself to avoid slipping back into denial that it happened the way it happened. I can’t live like this. I don’t want to live a lie but sometimes the lie is what keeps me functioning. My therapist is away for a month and this means I have no one to push me to deal with this thing. I don’t know what to do.

__label__0 Need to make a move now or never Update: I texted her more about it and she forgot about what happened until I reminded her! She said It’s not off the table, she just felt braver yesterday due to the liquid courage. So I just asked if she wants to hang one last time, maybe go somewhere like we did last time and have a drink and listen to music. And if something happens or doesn’t happen it doesn’t matter.

__label__0 His reply:  "Thanks for not punching me!" All-in-all, I like this guy, he's been an OK manager to me, I've gotten all of my raises since I've been under him, he has kids, so he understands me as a parent, etc. Am I making too big of a deal out of this? I thought about going to HR about it, but I'm in a position where I can't jeopardize this job, and I'm not the most well-liked person on the team (nothing that I did, I was hired externally for a position that 3 internals wanted), for whatever that's worth. Your thoughts?

__label__0 Recovery feels familiar, so it's less scary, but I'm also so much more tired of it all. I want to move on. I had been able to move on! I got so much stronger! And now I'm back here, a delicate PTSD flower.

__label__1 She still invites me to things and hasn't started dating anyone else (or even talked about it), but frankly, I'm starting to feel kind of pathetic asking her to hang out after she turned me down for the date. I do like her as a friend, but have started thinking of her as more than that and it's hard for me to ignore that when we spend time together. It's even starting to affect my self-esteem a bit, because usually if someone turns me down (no matter how reasonable the excuse) I just move on to someone else and spend less time with them, but it's a bit harder when that person is already your friend. My questions are: should I just give up on the potential of a romantic future with this person, or is it possible she's still feeling things out (like she says)? And regardless of this, should I start spending less time with her/stop inviting her to things (even if just for my own sake)?

__label__1 I want to move forward with my life but seem to have dug myself such a deep hole that I can't climb out. It just seems to be a vicious cycle of can't get a job because I don't have a place, get a job, can't get to job because I don't have a car or license, can't get license or car because I don't have a job. Don't even have a phone currently (this one will change soon). Can't get any assistance because I have no residency. I feel forever fucked in this spiral of shit that I myself have created but can't seem to flush.

__label__0 A <url> has been set up and I’m hoping to help get a bit more assistance from this community. He is one of the hardest working guys I know and I love him like a brother. You can tell by the amount already raised that he is a good man who has the support and love of his community, friends and family around him. It is quite costly to transfer the remains of a loved one across the globe though and there are medical expenses and final bills on top of this that need to be paid for. Any assistance this community is willing to offer would be very much appreciated.

__label__1 It’s really kind of ruining my ability to empathize with some people Bc of comments they’ve made in the past. I witnessed the attempted suicide of my sister and then subsequent self harm targeting just towards myself for the purpose of manipulation and dealt with no one believing that it happened. So many people have told me be happy it was a failed attempt, failing to recognize the damage knowing someone I love could want to hurt me so badly did. Not to mention other abuse I dealt with after that. Trauma shouldn’t be a competition.

__label__0 I'm using a throwaway for obvious reasons, however I could ready use the advice of others right now as I don't know what to do. I met this wonderful girl in November, and everything was going great, she was special enough that I let her meet my friends and family, and I met her siblings and mother as well. She had told me that she had this friend [M21] that she met online. They have never met in person, but she said it was all strictly friendship and nothing else. She mentioned how she helped him get through suicide and that he was a really good person.

I met this wonderful girl in November, and everything was going great, she was special enough that I let her meet my friends and family, and I met her siblings and mother as well. She had told me that she had this friend [M21] that she met online. They have never met in person, but she said it was all strictly friendship and nothing else. She mentioned how she helped him get through suicide and that he was a really good person.
__label__0 To start, I feel like I should share why I wanted to be here today to read this statement myself. For six and a half years, I was in a relationship with Luis. The first time he physically assaulted me, I was 18. That was the first time I had been knocked unconscious by another human. The choking incident that we are here for today was the first incident of domestic violence that I reported to the police.

I am worried because my 9 year old watched the whole thing and was so scared she was shaking. Sorry this is so long. I guess I just needed to vent.

But I hate these feelings and they are just the tip of the iceburg that is ptsd. I felt like I needed to say something somwhere though.

__label__1 I beg him to let go of me so I can get my phone and call my dad. I bang on the floor and scream for help to try to get the downstairs neighbours' attention. He mocks my crying and tells me he's not doing anything to me, that I'm freaking out over nothing. We're struggling against each other, his elbow hitting my face, his arm occasionally choking me. I fight hard to inch towards my phone to get help, but any time I get close he grabs my phone and throw it out of my reach.

__label__0 What's the best way for me to hold out for a couple days? The only things I was able to pack was some clothes and my phone. Bought some spam, figured it was going to be tasty but nah it just tastes like salt. Honestly I think the biggest thing for me is to just stay sane. Goodluck to everyone out there.

__label__1 I am losing my place on the 20th and freaking out. I am not sure what to do as phone just got shut off and funds are depleted. The emergency funds I had are now gone as my apartment recently got broken into. I have no family and am truly at a loss here in las vegas. I feel like what might be best for me is to head back to pa where i am orignally from but without funds to pay for bus/plane out of las vegas.

__label__1 Can't put this under my true account, but I'm feeling horrible – I just completely screwed up a job application for a position I really wanted. Part of me is like "oh well not meant to be", but SERIOUSLY, the application was meticulous. My email? Nope – my computer crashed, I restarted with a draft email which I (stupidly) assumed had saved in the correct way. It hadn't.

__label__0 The first veteran to participate in the study received the marijuana on Monday at theScottsdale Research Institute in Phoenix, Arizona, the release stated. The study is taking place in two locations: in Phoenix, led by Dr. Sue Sisley, and at Johns Hopkins University in Baltimore, led by Ryan Vandrey. The study is recruiting adult military veterans who have experienced trauma during military service. Screening for volunteers began in January. Volunteers will complete 17 outpatient visits to one of the study location clinics in a 12-week period, with a follow-up visit in six months.

__label__0 I told him if he’s not careful, all this attention could make her fall in love with him. For a while, I noticed the behavior stopped. He wouldn’t stay up as late, they stopped working out for a little bit, the glances and flirting stopped, and I noticed they weren’t talking as much, because they both talked to me more. However, recently it has started back up again, and almost as strongly as before. They do all the same things again, and they are always making eye contact with eachother or teasing and flirting.

__label__1 We decided to move states together and start a new life. We don’t live together (mutual decision). He wanted to marry me etc..and I started to see a change in his behavior ever since the move. He got flustered really easily or would get angry over something simple—traffic or a common life situation. He seems to have no patience anymore, especially with me and will just shut down.

__label__0 Hey guys. My girlfriend and I recently made a move from South Florida to Ohio for a change of scenery and a massive cost of living decrease. Due to the unexpected costs of the move and the cost of getting settled into our new home, we are severely in need of some basics to get us and our two pets through until we receive our first full checks from our new jobs. Our original dream was to move across the country to the west coast and start from scratch when we arrived. We had enough for the journey and to get us into a place, but not much else, so we reevaluated our finances and settled down in Ohio instead, about 1500 miles away from our previous home and about halfway to our original destination.

__label__0 Hey guys. My girlfriend and I recently made a move from South Florida to Ohio for a change of scenery and a massive cost of living decrease. Due to the unexpected costs of the move and the cost of getting settled into our new home, we are severely in need of some basics to get us and our two pets through until we receive our first full checks from our new jobs.

__label__1 I cook and clean every night and this is expected now. she berates my family (yeah my family is screwed up! but show me a family that isn't) and will freak out the moment I critiscise hers. she demanded I leave immediately this morning so had no time to pack belongings and arrange somewhere for myself and my cat to stay. today since being kicked out, just over 12 hours, I have received over 300 phone calls and over 1000 texts via all forms of communication.

__label__0 Hey. I turned 18 two weeks ago, and this weekend, I was booted from my parents house. My uncle is nice enough to let me rent out one of his places, but after rent, and utilities, and gas to get to work, I don’t have anything left over. Problem is, the new place isn’t furnished, and I wasn’t allowed to take anything from my house except my clothes. So, if anyone could help me get furniture for my new place, I’d greatly appreciate it.

__label__1 It would take until my mid-twenties before I stopped letting people hurt me. But the trauma remains. I've become a successful professional, happily married, with a home and pets (no children, I'll never have children after what I survived). I've been out of therapy for almost 10 years but my coping mechanisms have been failing. I'm having breakdown after breakdown after the slightest trigger and there are SO MANY triggers!

__label__0 I know I am still young and there is so much more coming in life but sometimes, I just feel this is not where I want to be and I sometimes get sad that I am not doing the things I want to be doing. I really want to travel and it really is hard to find people to go with. I would love to go solo but I am sometimes fearful of asking my parents because I don't want them to convince me otherwise/tell me no. I have this huge wanderlust and I want to see the world and constantly learn. I did apply to a grad program with many global opportunities to fulfill the dream of mine and I am excited as well.

__label__0 As an aside, it really kind of messes you up when the DA calls and tells you that in less than a week your abuser will be putting in a final plea; if you'd like to attend, please come for at least half a day to see what will happen. So, talked to my therapist about this and I had already told the DA I want him to see jail time not just 2 years of probation with state mandated drug treatment. isn't this also really awful as now they'll just forever say it was because of their addiction and never take full responsibility for their own actions? I digress, I demanded that he gives me a face to face apology. My therapist thinks it might be a bad idea as it's been less than a year and she thinks he will only lie and tell me he's sorry because I've requested it.

__label__0 I clearly hold it to such high regards... I would think, "no one's this stupid" but apparently people are. If anyone is wondering why i didn't ignore it, I thought I wasn't being clear in what I was saying and thought if I just bluntly told it, it would understand and go away. When I kept saying it wasn't listening, for some reason, I believed I wasn't communicating clearly or I was being "too nice" by "hinting at it". Turns out abusers do this thing where they deliberately don't listen to people calling them out.

__label__1 I am so scared to go up to 10mg because I want to still be able to lose weight. My doc has suggested Prozac because it has had more success with weight loss than weight gain with majority of people. I just don't know what I want to do. I thought I was going to be able to get off meds but these physical symptoms which set off my hypocondria are coming back in full swing. Even though I KNOW it's anxiety, I can't break the loop of thoughts.

__label__0 I only have about $10 left in my bank account. My new job pays bi-weekly which means i'll be starving for about 3 weeks. While I do plan to visit the local food bank, I figured I might as well reach out to my fellow redditors also. I will leave the link to my wishlist down bellow. If you guys can help me I would gladly appreciate it!

While I do plan to visit the local food bank, I figured I might as well reach out to my fellow redditors also. I will leave the link to my wishlist down bellow. If you guys can help me I would gladly appreciate it!

__label__0 So many local counties and cities struggle with homelessness and put a lot of resources into fixing the problem. But I feel society as a whole needs to change in order to truly fix the problems at hand especially at the federal level. By at least having these conversations, we can start talking about how we as a nation might be able to change to help our neighbors. I hope this made a bit of sense. I have been up late and wanted to reflect on some of the previous conversations I have had with people trying to change the narrative on homelessness.

__label__0 I’m definitely keeping the child. We don’t own our house so will just go our separate ways. I’m totally open to him being part of the child’s life if he wants. I know he would be a good dad despite him turning out to be a terrible husband Thanks for the advice guys.

__label__0 This subreddit truly helped me during my toughest times with PTSD and I just wanted to share my gratitude. You guys are so wise and so strong and so endlessly kind to each other. I'm doing great now. After years of struggling I'm finally at a place where I feel comfortable in my own skin. Sure I still got some issues, but all in all life is balanced and peaceful.

__label__1 I saw a professional for a psych evaluation and though there are no flashbacks or nightmares, I still am placed with the ptsd label. I know this isn’t something you just “get over” I just thought I moved on from my “trauma” I watched a few episodes of bojack horseman and it’s thrown me into an episode of depression Idk I’m sad, I’m mad, I get irritable I have no idea what symptoms and triggers are for me, I just keep going because if I don’t I’ll stop and fall apart. I’m like a piece of glass being held together by masking tape. I would’ve rather been told I’m a sociopath/psychopath or a narcissist due to my severe apathy towards everything.

__label__1 This is all relevant because I'm slowly realizing that **keeping my relationship from my mother isn't sustainable**. I'm not a good liar. Eventually, the truth has to come out, because I cannot live like this. Problem-- my mother would HATE my boyfriend. Being a narcisist, she can't stand when I give anyone more attention or devotion than her.

__label__1 Thank you for reading and for your time. Update: I should probably add that I was terrified of my mom and never tried to provoke her. I never snuck out, never got in trouble at school, no drugs, no drinking, no bad friends, tried to keep my grades up as best as I had time for, and never ever back talked; even though I dreamt of serving it to her one day. My siblings would cry whenever they didn’t get what they wanted, they were rather spoiled, and would tell on me if I didn’t do what they wanted. Mom would be in the middle of homework or class and she’d just wail on me for no reason.

__label__1 Hi, I will not have a home in a few weeks . I'm living with an abusive, drug addict roommate whom has constantly stolen from me. I have asked cops etc to help and I'm told restraining order. Well, I figure I'm just going to leave when away from me. I'm mentally and physically exhausted, but I know I cannot endure this.

__label__1 Just recently started a job at subway, and during work I always feel immense pressure on me i start sweating constantly. I never thought I had a fear of human interaction but now I don’t know. I get extremely anxious knowing I’m going to have to work the next day. I am losing so much sleep, even now when I’m writing this, I haven’t touched my phone in a few hours but my mind wouldn’t stop rambling, making me feel horrible. It’s 1:33 am and I still can’t sleep.

I am losing so much sleep, even now when I’m writing this, I haven’t touched my phone in a few hours but my mind wouldn’t stop rambling, making me feel horrible. It’s 1:33 am and I still can’t sleep.

__label__1 how is it possible that he can drive and use his fist to punch you? did you do something wrong?". The only thing I got from the police was a worn out looking card to the social work department (and by the way they offer counselling - nothing else). To this day, they have not arrested him because apparently the attack occurred in the middle of two districts (apparently it's really hard to determine which district is responsible) and because of bureaucratic issues, the man has not been taken to questioning. My mother helped me tremendously by arranging the divorce for me, and in the divorce, we did not put any alimony.

__label__1 I have therapy, I'm on medication. It's so hard to just get through a week without thinking of him and now I can't stop picturing his stupid face. I want to crawl into a hole and just cry and scream. It sucks even more because I won't be able to see my therapist this week because of the 4th of July holiday. I'm so shaken up over this.

__label__1 The backpack had my social security card, passport, birth certificate, laptop, notebooks, and other important legal documents like my last lease agreement. I am on the street because my landlord in San Diego was making violent threats towards me and I had to flee. Police were called, and nothing was done. I moved to California a few years ago. I left my things with some people I trusted and they all stole them and sold them for money.

__label__0 From across the table their eyes met, and in that instant they saw their future as they held each other’s gaze—a picture of a grand love, and a future filled with hope. In that split second the young teenage boy fell in love with a shy teenage girl. 	She smiled sweetly while he spoke loudly. He did all he could to impress the timid girl that night. Little did he know she was already taken by him.

__label__0 I have a dog that I got during the abusive relationship that led to my PTSD,  though I could never prove it there were obvious signs that she was abused by my ex as well. She has always been very sensitive to how people are feeling and acting (when I have an episode with my celiac disease she will curl up by my stomach and won't leave my side) could this be  a starting point for me to train her to recognise when I have a major panic attack and just lay with me until it passes? I was going to find a dog training sub to post this on but some of you may have service dogs for your PTSD so I wanted to get your opinion as well!

__label__1 I'm in a well paid job. I have beautiful friends, and most of the best ones are women. I'm finally at a point in my life where I feel safe, have come to terms with the past, am able to give time and money to help others. And yet despite all these blessings I've been paralysed for the last week, unable to function at work. By a lie.

__label__1 I'm male and i live with my partner of 4 years. We have a 12 month old baby boy who is a very loved and cherished child. Early on in our relationship there were a couple of events that looking back i should have treated as red flags, basically my partner reacted volcanically to some fairly normal behaviour on my part such as messaging with a female friend (actually wife of one of my old mates) and me trying to arrange to meet my friends from home for beers (i live a couple of cities away from my home town). I wrote this stuff off as isolated incidents and we eventially bought a place together and decided to start the family we'd both always dreamt of. The pregnancy was kind of a beautiful bubble of love and anticipation and i was (and still am) elated by the arrival of our little boy.

Early on in our relationship there were a couple of events that looking back i should have treated as red flags, basically my partner reacted volcanically to some fairly normal behaviour on my part such as messaging with a female friend (actually wife of one of my old mates) and me trying to arrange to meet my friends from home for beers (i live a couple of cities away from my home town).

__label__0 I know this will prob get doe vote to oblivion but every time i see this phrase it just feels so negative. Anxiety can be cured, you can feel normal again and you could even say that managing it is a cure anyway. People without anxiety manage fear and anxiety on a day to day basis it's just it comes naturally to them without even noticing, that's the point we need to get ourselves back to in order to be cured. I'm guessing I'm not the only one that feels de-motivated when they see this phrase so maybe use it less on here guys?

I'm not strong enough to take care of myself, to fight back, to leave. And I can't work, I can't even answer phone calls because of my anxiety, how am I supposed to survive? My family doesn't understand my mental issues so I can't get help from them with it, they tell me I need to start looking for a job and I can't even say anything.

__label__0 At times, he would get stalker-ish, and she would remove him from her contacts. This would infuriate him, and he would create an alternate character to threaten her, saying how he is going to find her, kill her, and tell me about their relationship. Being scared, my wife would add him back, pretend to be friends, only to repeat this cycle over several times over the next few years. Yes, they somehow remained "friends" for years after this affair. The next stab came when I was sent to an Air Force base for a 3 month training for my job.

I just want to get this done  as food and everything like those necessities is taken care of, but I don't have the funds to get this done before the 7th. If you can help, it would be appreciated so much!

__label__0 My family thought it was a home invasion so the retrieved their guns and prepair to defend them selves. After the authorities knocked the door down they then announced them selves and threatened to kill everyone inside. My family dropped their guns and surrender peacefully. After several hours of ransacking our house the Feds arrested my little brother on charges that are of the upmost serious kind. He was not allowed to speak or talk to my parents.

__label__1  I feel like I have no personality or sense of self, and my mind will take sudden turns every week or so. I can get sudden obsessions for things and then drop them and lose interest instantly, because my whole set of core values, ideas and principles changes constantly. And I've seen people saying that it's normal. I highly doubt it's normal to change so drastically and so quickly, because I have to accommodate to a new personality every single week, and it's disturbing. Actually, there were times when I changed from one day to the other and it's so disturbing because I didn't know what was happening to me...I just woke up feeling and being completely different, like something changed everything about me overnight.

__label__1 I saw a shadow figure standing in my bedroom door... so I'm camped out in my mom's room. I have bipolar I as well, so it's likely that's the cause of the hallucinations. &#x200B; I can't take this. I've had several anxiety attacks in the last few weeks; twice, I was sent home from work about half an hour early.

__label__1 I have been always told that I was a burden, a waste of space and that I was a fuck up even tho I'm the only one in my family 2 get any qualifications nevermind getting into uni. I'll most likely end up homeless as I can't even work as I have little work experience and I try part time jobs just 2 end up having a panic attack early on which got me fired each time. My friends are all at uni doing well 2 which makes me feel worse while I'm at home being a sack of shit who stays indoors all day with no social interaction other than my parents berating me about life. I don't even know what 2 do and it's killing me. My friends constantly remark about me being a mess.

__label__1 I don't want a situation to come where she calls the police lying saying I hit her (anytime a domestic incident happens, it's automatically the guy's fault) She's called the police falsely on my dad twice, so I wouldn't put it passed her. So I'm writing this in the parking lot of my college afraid to go home. Awesome

__label__0 My heart races and palpitates. I've gone on autopilot, but I've never experienced anything like an out of body experience. When this intense part fades I just get stuck in my head for the rest of the day, exhausted. Has anyone experienced something like this? How do you cope when ain't nobody got time for that?

__label__1 Already borrowed what I can from family and friends, living on my own, and rather exhausted that. I'd rather not share my specific adress in public, so PM if you want to help. Got no preferences, but a kebab or pizza with varied stuff in it would be great for nutrition. Hate asking for this, but I'm at a low point and getting rather desperate. If ordering isn't the thing for you, a small amount of money to buy something cheap at the store is just as good.

__label__1 Every minor detail feels just so overwhelming that I feel suffocated and panicky all the time. I imagine others here have gone through something similar, so I wanted to ask about your experience with grad school applications. How did you survive? How did you preserve your mental health, and do the best that you could? Thanks so much.

__label__1 I simply stayed home and did nothing, I was basically a shut-in hiding from the world. I had really awful anxiety at one point, I never went to the doctor for it, but there was a time when I got a panic attack and I had to call a friend, who helped me get through it. Then everything changed, I got an opportunity to work at a really tough (to be honest I would call the working conditions atrocious), minimum-wage job but I learned a lot of life lessons (and it changed my view on society). Then I started reading more books to improve myself, and that was when I started to earn some savings. I returned to school and the first semester back I managed to get As in half of my courses.

I had really awful anxiety at one point, I never went to the doctor for it, but there was a time when I got a panic attack and I had to call a friend, who helped me get through it. Then everything changed, I got an opportunity to work at a really tough (to be honest I would call the working conditions atrocious), minimum-wage job but I learned a lot of life lessons (and it changed my view on society).

__label__0 She'll order so much food, and binges on it, while downing shots the whole time. The way she orders food and drinks kinda makes me change my eating and drinking habits when I'm with her. It's like I'm binging too. She always excuses herself to the bathroom right after a meal and I know she's purging. The more recent time I hung out with her, I put my foot down a little more and told her i didn't want to pay for so much food, and that I wasn't doing shots (I never do shots, but she always orders them for me when I'm out with her and then is really manipulative in order to pressure me to do them).

__label__1 Why did I have to scream in pain? Sometimes the bashings would be so bad that I would call my mum while she was at work [sometimes my brother and I would be home alone after I returned from school, when he would torment and bash me]. I would run into my room and lean against the bedroom door with all my weight while my brother kicked and punched through it from the other side. Once, the wood splintered and went into my back. Still no-one stopped him.

__label__0 Everything was absolutely perfect. He is always very quiet, but is a complete sweetheart, and very warm and kind once he trusts someone. He’s pretty much the spitting image of what I imagined of the person I would marry when I was young. The one thing about him that would have seemed “off” is that he never really talked at all about his life before the Army. I know what city he is from, and a couple inconsequential details, but nothing significant.

__label__1 &#x200B; Hey everyone, Being that Hurricane Florence just occurred less than a month ago, my  personal experience with Hurricane Florence consisted of having my  maternal extended family evacuated from Craven County and coming to stay  with my family in Wilson, having to have family members be rescued from  their home due to a severe flash flood, and dealing with the shock and  emotions of loss once returning. On top of that, two of my family  members have been displaced and all of them are still in the stages of  recovery. This is the first natural disaster that has left a major  impact on my family as far as trying to find resources and dealing with  insurance adjusters and etc.

__label__1 As a result I had a total burn out. Many months ago the situation with my abuser came up between this friend and I. I explained some stuff but she said it was too overwhelming for her to hear so I never brought it up again. My response to her saying I do nothing was just explaining that I don’t tell people why I’m in this situation because it scares people. It’s often retraumatizing when I tell people and their reaction is either to get scared and shut me down or not believe me at all. Her response was that a lot of people have f’d up things they have to deal with but they still have to do stuff.

__label__1 When we returned we discovered that one of our beloved pets' health had taken a turn for the worse and we had to them euthanized, so that was a setback. We still have not been able to pay rent for May. Our landlords are trying to work with us but I believe they are becoming impatient, also since the 5th there is an additional $5 owed for every day that it is late so the amount is growing. We are also still very behind in our utility bills. I was able to negotiate something with the company that I finance my car through so that it would be easier to make the payments but could still use some help paying my insurance this month before it is cancelled again (It was cancelled briefly in April but I was able to get it reinstated).

__label__0 My sister lives with her BF and my 2 year old nephew about 30 minutes away from me. A few days ago she asked if her and my nephew can come spend next Monday - Friday with me because her BF is going out of town and she doesn't want to be in the house alone without him (they live with his family so I guess sometimes it gets uncomfortable). I said okay sure. I live in 500 sqft a studio but I have a pullout couch in addition to my bed. I've been with my BF for 3 years and about 5 months ago he unofficially moved in with me (unofficial because we share bills and all of his stuff is here but his mail and whatnot still goes to his parents where he was living before).

__label__1 Me and my Dad aren't on speaking terms, however we do live in the same house. Mainly because I'm not financially able to leave and live on my own. I do plan on leaving, but until I make enough money to do so I'm stuck here. I want to share what has led to this point, because to be honest I feel like I'm pathetic, weak in incapable of accomplishing anything. Everything I do to move forwards seems to be halted and I feel like I'm being pushed back.

__label__0 There is a waitlist to be called when they become available. I do not want to start training an adult dog from the shelter to become a service dog. I think there is too much room for error if I'm not the one who socialized the dog from the beginning. Any advice or notes from those who have them would be great. Thanks.

__label__0 I have struggled all my life with weight. For the past month I have been dieting like a madman, counting calories, working out, etc. I have lose weight before in mass amounts so I do know how to diet and weigh food. But the scale will not budge, inches will not budge, nothing. So I decided that I am going to talk to my doctor about tapering off lexapro next week when I go in to see her.

__label__0 So thank you. My day got better. I am on medicine so I took my alprazolam and went to a store to try and find a dress for an upcoming wedding party. No luck. Dressing room lady was rude as hell but for the first time, I didn’t really put up with it.

__label__0 He doesnt seem bothered about calling me or meeting me unless I initiate. We dont talk for very long as he still lives with his parents and is apparently always "busy" helping his mum. Im mostly available, as I work part time as Im a student but I live in a rented shared flat. We seldom talk about the future. I want to talk about the future, I planned to work abroad this year as I graduate soon but stopped those plans after meeting him as he is only in college and will take another 3 years until he finishes education.

__label__1 So, long story short my parents are terribly abusive, I'm almost 30 and it took me this long, with the help of my wife to realize this. Lots of things happened, too many to list in a single post, but it got much worse last year when my daughter was molested by my younger brother. We had asked my parents to watch my two daughters due to a medical emergency, and that's when it happened, with my father in the room, his eyes glued to his cell phone. We involved CPS, the police, but my daughter didn't quite tell the police everything, and with their investigation, they could not press charges against him. After their investigation was complete, we informed my parents of what happened, and they called my then 5 year old daughter a liar to her face.

__label__1 I'm just really scared in general of not living up to expectations my partner may have. A lot of my life is built on trying to be exciting, fun, or entertaining, I'm just scared I won't be able to keep it up for my partner. The last thing I want them is to describe their boyfriend (me) as bland or boring, but I feel like that's how I'll make them feel, and it'll just lead to heartache. So, I've come to the most recent conclusion (after seeing my two best friends get girlfriends and me being the awkward loser who can't get one). That maybe I'm not the type of person who's built for relationships.

__label__0 Which now leads me to where I am now. I had a talk with person A and she wants to get back together. Person B really wants a relationship with me. I don’t want to be a douche bag and cut things off with person b and then go back after my ex and have to deal with all the drama in between that. But I don’t really want my ex(person a) to go back and try to get into relationships and talk to all these guys.

__label__0 My sister messaged me "CALL ME ASAP" I received her message at 1am when I woke up at my own home to use the restroom. I called my sister at that time, she answered the phone and I heard yelling and screaming. What happened was, My sister gave my father a ride back to wherever it was he came from - to get him out of their home. My father would not leave my moms home unless she also came along.

__label__1 I was at work today and this guy I just met was just exuding this layer of confidence, he was; to an extent everything I wanted to be when it came to my relationships with others. There was no reason to hate him, but I just felt this serious sense of envy toward him. He just magically knew what and how to talk to everyone, like the people that I wanted to talk to, but could never, he had already been there and done that. Now nothing is stopping me from doing what he has already done, but like, I feel like that entire pathway has just been blocked off, because of this envy. I'm really not sure whether I should start to model myself over him or just remain like this.

__label__1 I was at work today and this guy I just met was just exuding this layer of confidence, he was; to an extent everything I wanted to be when it came to my relationships with others. There was no reason to hate him, but I just felt this serious sense of envy toward him. He just magically knew what and how to talk to everyone, like the people that I wanted to talk to, but could never, he had already been there and done that. Now nothing is stopping me from doing what he has already done, but like, I feel like that entire pathway has just been blocked off, because of this envy. I'm really not sure whether I should start to model myself over him or just remain like this.
__label__1 We were doing so good.” I’m feel as if I can’t be angry at any of his actions, and my words mean nothing,  and my threats are empty. He makes me feel so horrible about myself when I even show the slightest bit of distance from him, he treats me as if I owe him sex. Never forces me to but will bring it up constantly, about how we haven’t and it’s just “makes him feel so bad and self conscious about himself” I don’t know what to do I told him I wanted to move back home and he went in behind me and unpacked my bags as I packed them.

__label__1 That was nice. But now that we're close to the point of no return, with a flight booked so he can come see her(I agreed to travel out of our house for the week), and they seem to be bonding big time(I love you's abound), I'm not sure what to do with myself. On one hand I want to let loose and detach, let her have fun, and do so myself. If it leads to a new LTR for her, awesome. But what kills me I guess is the uncertainty.

__label__0 I’ve been in the mood since Friday night, we had a date and when we got tired and I let her go to sleep. Saturday morning I tried doing some forplay and she stopped me and told me to wait till later that night and she would make it up to me. Saturday night rolls around and she just falls asleep. Sunday morning I climb out of bed and start breakfast, and she said “Too bad you were asleep this morning, I tried to wake you up for something special...” Later that day we were getting ready for a birthday party, and she said, “I wish we could be undressing instead, but we got a party to go to...” I took that as a hint that later tonight she’ll finally be in the mood.

__label__0 Hey guys I just want to hear your opinions on this. So I’ve only had ptsd for about 5 years now after a near death experience and I just want to know if you guys think it is possible for me to be able to get rid of it for good. That fact that I was not born with a generalized anxiety disorder really makes me believe that one day I’ll be able to be the person I was before the incident. The issue is that even when I ask my therapist about this he tells me that my anxiety will always be there from now on, I just have to learn how to deal with it. What are your thoughts?

This is why I was hoping that, if you are interested, you could send me stories of your experiences in an abusive relationship - whatever detail you choose to send, it doesn't have to be anything "epic" and "grand," it could be the smallest segment that you hold significance to.

__label__0 We are begging you for **$200** to buy bus tickets for the **4** of us to travel via bus. It is a **14 hour** road travel from our current city. The $200 will cover our travel to there and going back here. &nbsp; This would really mean a lot for me and my family, we just want to see our grandfather one last time.

__label__0 We spoke of Buddhism and karma and about how everything is connected. Turns out, everything is related. My grandmother was a bitch to my mother, my mother was a bitch to me, I had to act out in a way or another. The Perpetrator, the Victim, and the Rescuer interchange positions. I've been told I show symptoms of BPD, ADHD, but I haven't been diagnosed clinically.

__label__1 I was venting how pissed off she made me to one of my friends. I didn't know [3M] was listening to our conversation. He asked me and my friend what a period was. My friend took him to his mother who was in the kitchen. She just told us to keep an eye on him while she did some things.

__label__1 For example, I'm selling something that's worth £50? You can have it for £10. I hate it, I want to cry. I've had items listed for about 2 weeks, they're all responsibly priced or under and I'm having to accept low ball offers as I have no other choice. I would never let myself in a million years do this if I wasn't homeless but the clock is ticking and I need to move.

__label__0 Sorry this is so long! Thanks in advance if you manage to read it :) My best friend Grace and I met when we were 10 and became best friends almost immediately. She was always the "leader" in our friendship ever since we were young. I didn't mind it, I actually kind of liked it since I was a very shy kid who had no confidence anyway.

__label__0 She has a temper and some anger issues. I'm the only one that has seen that side of her, maybe I'm just the cause. To add to the story, she left me with scars on my arms a few months ago while I was trying to calm her down while giving her kisses. She dug her nails into me pretty severely. I had pictures which the officers asked to see, which I showed them.

__label__0 Writing is one of my methods, and I wrote this and I would really appreciate feedback or any insight on why I am not being able to withhold myself today. “I’m writing this, because I am experiencing and attempting to avoid a full blown panic attack. I am stronger then my negative thoughts, and I do have the power to control them. Writing about it makes it seem less real, and it isn’t. My dream keeps playing in my head like a record and each time i get a glimpse of the record I avoid it.

__label__0 I’m looking for advice to try to help a relative. She’s going through a very ugly divorce with her husband who’s trying to get sole custody of their three-year-old son. He’s dating a woman with a substance abuse problem and a criminal record. He met her three weeks ago and has been taking their son to sleep at her residence (unbeknownst to my relative till recently). This Monday he told her he’s filing for divorce.

__label__1 It's not really safe for me to be driving. I can't even function enough to do the grocery shopping. Sometimes it goes into an actual panic attack, but not too often. My husband has recently banned me from going anywhere alone unless absolutely necessary (like to work). Is this something a service dog would be helpful for?

I don't remember a ton, but I do remember pulling away and immediately telling Lily "oh my god, I can't believe I just did this." Like a drunk idiot, I called my boyfriend.

__label__0 My girlfriend has been under major strain since last year when took a new job, she has been depressed and has mood swings for half a year now. She has always been inverted and melancholy, but I feel that the new pressure has pushed it to the verge of disaster. I tried to talk to her, but she responded negatively and she had not done anything to help. In recent months she has said that I am depressed and need help. She told me that I had a symptom or another when she was actually symptomatic.

Their pictures would appear as the individual told an abridged version of their story and how this organization helped them.

__label__1 I just got a new job and I won't get paid until the 18th. I've only been unemployed for a week now, the company I worked for closed and after bills I have no money. I was already trying to get on my feet from being let go from my long-term job in October. If you could help me I will contribute to this sub when I can, pay you back, reciprocate in any way that I can. I don't have family that I can ask for help (both parents are deceased, no siblings, not close with Aunts and Uncles).

I'd get punished for playing with them too, or for letting them use the restroom when they asked. She would keep them in their crates for hours, sometimes the whole day. If they were too "bad" they didn't get fed. Once I remember my dog went three days without dinner.

__label__0 “Hey you can’t lay down like that man.” I could tell you what I wanted to say to the oversized Krillin looking mother… *inhale* but that was because I was tired. I sat down to kill time before the shelters in the morn began to open. I decided to make base in Atlanta, because I knew leaving any further North would make it hard to return to Savannah with the ticket that I had. I was bound to Georgia, until court day.

Before the games started I got into a discussion with a friend and a few points to take away from the conversation were: - People don't know how to react when I'm around because I'm overly sensitive. - People don't have the persistence to continue trying to help. - They don't feel like they can help so they've been avoiding me.

__label__1 I legitimately do not know anyone who has survived this, and I feel like i'm not even human any more. As I type this, i'm sobbing, because it's all just so FUCKING truly disheartening. I used to be a person. I feel like a ghost now. Are there any steps I can take at all whatsoever to start my turn back into normalcy, or am I trapped inside of this until I either die or claw my way out of whatever hole i've fallen into?

__label__0 Later in life she would try for children with my great Grandad hoping for a Daughter and have four Sons and then finally a daughter that would later die. Now she's the only one of her 9 brothers and sisters still alive. As sad as all that is, honestly if she hadn't told me I would never have known. My Nan is the most cheerful energetic and lovely almost 90 year old that I have ever met. She looks 20 years younger than she is, and although she has multiple cancers, she still spends every day looking after my great grandad who she's been together with since her parents died.

I also have depersonalization issues, and want to be alone more often then not. I think the fact that I can be so outgoing and positive most of the time, my friends don't realize that I struggle quite a bit some days.

__label__1 So, I survived years of physical and sexual abuse as a kid. I'm finally at the place in my counselling where my therapist and I both think I'm ready to work through it. I really like her and trust her, but the guided questions she asks remind me of how few specific details I actually remember. Today she had me close my eyes to focus on where in my body I was feeling my anger, and it was like I was whooshing through a tunnel until she wasn't in the room anymore, and my body felt all weird and flat, my head would feel gigantic and then absolutely minuscule, my hands would be gigantic and then my feet.....I don't know how to explain it. It's like that scene in Inside Out where the characters become abstract shapes for awhile?

__label__1 Things got better in middle school (thankfully) but it’s sad how literally 5 years as a young child (when life was supposed to be good) were so rough and still affect my life to this day. My home life wasn’t super bad but school was a living hell. I was excluded from everything and still to this day I tend to view the world as harsh and unaccepting. Sorry for the rant, it’s just sad how cruel teachers and students can be in elementary school. Bullying in elementary school directly caused so many of my mental health issues.

__label__1 She has a history of being extremely over the top, and in our most recent argument she verbally abused me just for because I was upset that she broke my trust by telling my personal details to someone I didn't know. She did apologize a good day later, but only very vaguely about using cuss words and in a "I'm sorry you feel that way" kind of sense. I'm guessing a traditional "we need to talk, it's just not working out" approach would just end up with her blowing up again, and since all my past relationships ended very amicably I'm not sure what to expect. Because she can be incredibly toxic, I've considered just blocking her and essentially "ghosting," but I also feel like that would be very rude and she'd at least deserve an explanation. How do I break up with her without having her potentially flipping out at me?

I'm guessing a traditional "we need to talk, it's just not working out" approach would just end up with her blowing up again, and since all my past relationships ended very amicably I'm not sure what to expect. Because she can be incredibly toxic, I've considered just blocking her and essentially "ghosting," but I also feel like that would be very rude and she'd at least deserve an explanation. How do I break up with her without having her potentially flipping out at me?

__label__1 ? What if I am at a friends party and a man whispers in my ear that he likes to stare at me so he can touch himself later....but he is dating my friend and he knows I don’t want to upset her?? ? What if I am in the car with a man and some lady cuts him off and he gets road rage and says he wants to “drag her out of the car by her hair and cut her nipples off” but then later says he “obviously didn’t mean it”?? ?

__label__1 It feels very weird to feel like you have nothing to cry about, then cry, and then go back to not being sad right after you cry....) I just don't get it....I thought stress was something that built up over time....like you hop from 5 -> 6 after a few months of continued stress...Is that not how it works? Does stress fluctuate between 1 and 10 on a daily basis? And how much do "stress relieving activities" actually help? I just cried does that mean I'll go from 7 to 5?
